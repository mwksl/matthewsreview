# Finding state, score gates, and lanes

Normative spec for finding state, score-gate routing, and lane partitioning.
AGENTS.md keeps a TL;DR; this file is the reference. `bin/schema-v1.json` is
the on-disk source of truth for artifact shape — this doc is the
human-readable companion.

## Finding state model

Three states, one disposition enum. States transition; dispositions classify.

**States:** `open` | `attempted` | `resolved`. Valid transitions (enforced by `artifact-patch.py`):

```
open → attempted       (Phase 8 ran)
attempted → resolved   (Phase 9 verified)
attempted → open       (Phase 9 classified partial or regression)
```

Any other transition is rejected. Leftover `attempted` on a fresh `:fix` → **hard abort** with deterministic recovery message.

**Disposition enum** (the primary routing key — filters and report selectors read this, not combinations of prose fields):

| disposition | Meaning | `current_state` | `is_actionable` | Set by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `below_gate` | `score_phase3 < 45` and single source family | `open` | `false` | Phase 3 |
| `pending_validation` | Gate-in parking; awaiting Phase 4 | `open` | `false` | Phase 3 |
| `disproven` | `score_phase4 < 45` | `open` | `false` | Phase 4 |
| `uncertain` | `score_phase4 45–59` | `open` | `false` | Phase 4 |
| `confirmed_mechanical` | `score_phase4 ≥ 60`, `actionability == auto_fixable` | `open` | `true` | Phase 4 |
| `confirmed_manual` | `score_phase4 ≥ 60`, `actionability == manual` | `open` | `false` | Phase 4 |
| `confirmed_report` | `score_phase4 ≥ 60`, `actionability == report_only` | `open` | `false` | Phase 4 |
| `pre_existing_report` | `origin == pre_existing` AND `origin_confidence == high` (override, regardless of score) | `open` | `false` | Phase 3 / re-asserted Phase 4 |
| `partial` | Phase 9 found fix incomplete; retry-eligible | `open` | `true` | Phase 9 |
| `regression` | Phase 9 found new adjacent issue; group reverted; retry-eligible | `open` | `true` | Phase 9 |
| `resolved` | Phase 9 verified | `resolved` | `false` | Phase 9 |

**Invariants** (enforced by writers):

- `is_actionable` is derived: `true` iff `disposition ∈ {confirmed_mechanical, partial, regression}`. Never set in conflict with `disposition`.
- `current_state == resolved` ⇔ `disposition == resolved`.
- `human_confirmation` is absent/null unless `:promote` has run. Present-and-non-null is a Phase 8 bypass of both lane filter and threshold (see Score gates). Promotion never mutates `score_phase4`.

## Score gates (normative)

Each rule sets `disposition`; `is_actionable` follows by derivation.

**Pre-existing override** (highest priority — evaluated before any score rule, re-asserted at end of Phase 4):

```
origin == "pre_existing" AND origin_confidence == "high"
  → disposition: pre_existing_report
  → is_actionable: false
  → regardless of score
```

**Phase 3 validation gate** (applies after the override):

```
score_phase3 < 45 AND single source family   → disposition: below_gate (does not enter Phase 4)
score_phase3 < 45 AND ≥ 2 source families    → advance to Phase 4 (auto-graduation)
score_phase3 >= 45                           → advance to Phase 4
```

**Phase 4 validation decision** (after Phase 4a deep / 4b light):

```
score_phase4 < 45    → disposition: disproven,  is_actionable: false
score_phase4 45–59   → disposition: uncertain,  is_actionable: false
score_phase4 >= 60   → disposition depends on actionability set by validator:
                         auto_fixable  → confirmed_mechanical   (is_actionable: true)
                         manual        → confirmed_manual (is_actionable: false)
                         report_only   → confirmed_report (is_actionable: false)
                       confirmed_strength: "moderate" (60–74) or "strong" (75+)
```

**Phase 9 outcome** (for findings attempted in a fix run):

```
verified    → disposition: resolved,   current_state: resolved
partial     → disposition: partial,    current_state: open   (retry-eligible)
regression  → disposition: regression, current_state: open   (retry-eligible;
              fix group reverted; fix_attempts[-1].output_sha = null)
```

**Phase 8 fix gate** (governs what `:fix` will touch):

```
current_state == open
  AND disposition ∈ {confirmed_mechanical, partial, regression}
  AND (
    human_confirmation != null                                      // promote bypass
    OR (
      impact_type ∈ {correctness, security}                         // lane filter
      AND score_phase4 >= threshold                                 // default 60
    )
  )
```

"Gate" means three different things: Phase 3 scoring gate (45) decides Phase-4 entry; Phase 4 confirmation gate (45/60/75) maps `score_phase4` → disposition; Phase 8 fix gate (default 60, user-tunable via `:fix <N>`) is the composite gate above. `human_confirmation != null` bypasses both lane filter and threshold — promotion is additive metadata, not a state mutation. `below_gate` is a *disposition name*, not a threshold; `:walkthrough` at default Qualifying scope excludes it (run `:walkthrough 0` with the Full tier to audit Phase-3 demotions).

## Lanes

- **Deep lane** (correctness, security): Phase 4a Opus per candidate with blast-radius tracing + comprehensive fix proposal; passes through Phase 5 cross-cutting. Phase 8 processes `confirmed_mechanical` here by default.
- **Light lane** (ux, policy, architecture): Phase 4b Sonnet confirmation, report-biased (validators may emit `auto_fixable` for very mechanical rules, but `manual` and `report_only` are the common outcomes). Phase 8 excludes light-lane `confirmed_mechanical` unless `human_confirmation != null` (set by `:promote` or `:walkthrough`). `:walkthrough` exists to close this asymmetric default, restricted to its own score floor (default 60, independent of fix-gate threshold).
