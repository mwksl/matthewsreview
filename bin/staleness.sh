# staleness.sh — file-overlap staleness classifier (DESIGN §21.4, §13.3).
#
# Decides whether a code review is still "fresh" relative to the current
# HEAD by intersecting the files changed since the reviewed SHA with a
# caller-supplied list of reviewed files (artifact.reviewed_files_all;
# the full safety envelope — every file in the review-time diff, not
# just files that produced findings, see §13.3).
#
# Usage:
#   staleness.sh --reviewed-sha <sha> --reviewed-files <f>[,<f>...]
#   staleness.sh --reviewed-sha <sha> --reviewed-files @-   # read files from stdin, one per line
#
# Classifications (§21.4):
#   safe    HEAD == reviewed_sha. stdout: `safe`. exit 0.
#   warn    HEAD moved, but no reviewed files touched. stdout: `warn: ...`. exit 0.
#   unsafe  HEAD moved AND one or more reviewed files touched. stderr
#           names the files, emits structured ERROR/Action guidance, and
#           exits 1.
#
# Other exits: 1 on git error / unreachable SHA (both treated as "can't
# prove safe" → same exit as unsafe). 64 on usage error.
#
# Git is invoked from the current working directory; callers cd first.
# @- mode reads one path per line from stdin for large --reviewed-files
# lists (reviewed_files_all can exceed ARG_MAX on big diffs).

Usage: $(basename "$0") --reviewed-sha <sha> --reviewed-files <f>[,<f>...|@-]

Classifies current HEAD relative to a reviewed SHA:
  safe    HEAD == reviewed_sha
  warn    HEAD moved but no reviewed files changed
  unsafe  HEAD moved AND reviewed files changed

--reviewed-files accepts a comma-separated list OR "@-" to read one
path per line from stdin (use this when the list is long enough to
approach ARG_MAX).
