# adamsreview

Five personal Claude Code slash commands packaged as a plugin (`adamsreview`) distributable via `/plugin marketplace add`:

- **`/adamsreview:review`** — multi-lens code review of a branch or PR (phases 0–6).
- **`/adamsreview:add`** — inject externally-sourced findings (Claude Code cloud `/ultrareview` paste, an Opus once-over, a teammate's note) into the most recent review's existing artifact. Free-form paste mode dispatches a Sonnet normalizer; structured `--file/--line/--claim` mode skips it. One Sonnet dedup pass against existing findings; Phase 4 validation lane-aware (no Wave 2); re-renders + re-publishes to the existing PR comment.
- **`/adamsreview:walkthrough`** — interactive driver for findings `/adamsreview:fix` would skip; per-finding briefing + options + recommendation, batched re-render/re-publish, decisions-log PR comment (see DESIGN §28).
- **`/adamsreview:fix`** — automated fix loop for auto-fixable findings surfaced by `/adamsreview:review` (phases 7–9).
- **`/adamsreview:promote`** — human override that promotes a single finding to auto-fixable (bypasses the Phase 8 impact_type lane filter and score threshold; see DESIGN §27).

Command files live at bare-stem paths under `commands/` (`review.md`, `add.md`, `walkthrough.md`, `fix.md`, `promote.md`); shared phase fragments and the prompt references live under `fragments/`; helper scripts and the artifact schema live under `bin/`. The plugin runtime auto-adds `bin/` to `$PATH` on load — no symlinks, no install script.

## Recommended flow

Not required — each command is independent — but they work best in this order on a non-trivial PR:

1. **Review.** `/adamsreview:review` — or `/adamsreview:review --ensemble` if you have the CodeRabbit + Codex CLIs installed and want a multi-source review at higher token cost.
2. **Add.** *(optional)* `/adamsreview:add <paste...>` — if you ran a parallel review (cloud `/ultrareview`, Opus once-over, manual scan, etc.) that surfaced bugs the original review missed, paste the result here. The findings are validated by Phase 4 and land in the same artifact, deduped against what's already there. Auto-eligible additions feed step 4; non-eligible ones surface in step 3.
3. **Walkthrough.** *(optional)* `/adamsreview:walkthrough` — step through every finding the fix command would skip at the default threshold (deep-manual, deep-report, deep-below-gate, and the entire light lane including light `confirmed_mechanical`). Each finding gets a briefing + options + recommendation; promote the ones you want auto-fixed with tailored fix-hints, skip the rest. Posts a decisions log to the PR for audit.
4. **Fix.** `/adamsreview:fix` — applies every auto-eligible finding (including whatever was added in step 2 and promoted in step 3). Default: one combined commit for all surviving fixes; pass `--granular-commits` for one commit per fix group. Per-group Phase-9 outcome lands in the commit message either way.

Steps 2 and 3 are optional. You can go straight from review to fix if you only care about the auto-eligible findings the original review surfaced.

Steps 2–4 can land days or weeks after step 1 — the review artifact persists under `~/.adams-reviews/<slug>/<branch>/`.

`/adamsreview:promote <id>` remains useful for one-off manual promotions outside the walkthrough flow (e.g. promoting a `disproven` finding with `--force`, or conceptually looping over a set of IDs — `F003`, `F037`, `F039` — with `--defer-publish` on each so only the final invocation re-publishes to the PR).

## Documents

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — operational guide for Claude Code sessions working in this repo. Self-contained for routine work; read first on a fresh session.
- **`docs/archive/`** — frozen design + build docs (2026-04-19 onward). `DESIGN.md` (rev 8) is the original normative spec; `BUILD.md` is the stage-by-stage journal. Not maintained; consult only for historical rationale behind a specific decision. See `docs/archive/README.md`.
- **`plans/`** — per-stage plan files. Stages 1–3 + 2.5/2.6/2.7/2.8 are closed. `stage-4-fragment-shrink.md` is the one live plan.

## Dependencies

### Runtime

| Tool | Version | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uv` | 0.7+ | `artifact-patch.py`, `artifact-render.py` | `brew install uv`. Scripts use a PEP 723 inline-script shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`) so `uv` fetches and caches `jsonschema` on first run — no venv, no global pip install |
| `python3` | 3.10+ | invoked by `uv` | `uv` will install a matching Python if needed |
| `bash` | 4+ | all `*.sh` helpers | macOS default `/bin/bash` is 3.2 — scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and rely on `brew install bash` or the user's newer default. On Windows, Git for Windows ships bash 5+ via Git Bash and Claude Code auto-routes through it |
| `jq` | 1.6+ | `artifact-read.sh`, log helpers | `brew install jq` |
| `gh` | 2.x | `artifact-publish.sh`, `external-scrape.sh` | `brew install gh`, `gh auth login` |
| `git` | 2.x | everywhere | standard |

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

1. Install deps: `brew install uv jq gh bash git` (macOS) or the distro equivalent. Bash 4+ is required — macOS's default `/bin/bash` is 3.2.
2. In a Claude Code session: `/plugin marketplace add adamjgmiller/adamsreview`
3. In the same session: `/plugin install adamsreview@adamsreview`

### Windows (native)

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) — provides Git Bash (bash 5+) and `git`, which Claude Code uses internally. Claude Code auto-routes `#!/usr/bin/env bash` helpers through Git Bash; set `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` if Git Bash lives in a non-default location (see *Troubleshooting*).
2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/), and the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).
3. In a Claude Code session: `/plugin marketplace add adamjgmiller/adamsreview` and `/plugin install adamsreview@adamsreview`.

### Install from a local checkout

If you've cloned this repo and prefer running from source — or you want to pin to a specific commit — two paths work without the GitHub marketplace round-trip:

- **Persistent install from a local path.** In a Claude Code session, run `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/adamsreview` then `/plugin install adamsreview@adamsreview`. Same end state as the GitHub marketplace flow above — the plugin is registered under `~/.claude/` and survives restarts. Use `.` in place of the absolute path if your cwd is already the clone.
- **One-shot via `--plugin-dir`.** `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/adamsreview` launches Claude Code with the clone loaded as a plugin for that session only. Nothing is written to `~/.claude/`; re-launch without the flag and the plugin is gone. Handy for trying the plugin without any persistent state, or for running a specific checkout side-by-side with an installed version.

Both paths still require the runtime deps listed above (`uv`, `jq`, `gh`, `bash` 4+, `git`).

### Commands (post-install)

All invocations are plugin-namespaced:

- `/adamsreview:review [--ensemble] [--full]`
- `/adamsreview:add [<paste...>] [--file <path> --line <N> --claim "..."]`
- `/adamsreview:walkthrough [threshold]`
- `/adamsreview:fix [threshold]`
- `/adamsreview:promote <finding_id> [--reason "..."] [--fix-hint "..."]`

No separate Python dep install. First invocation of any `*.py` helper triggers `uv` to resolve `jsonschema` (or any other declared dep) and cache it — this can take a few seconds on a fresh machine (see *Troubleshooting*). Subsequent runs are fast.

### Plugin-author iteration

If you're hacking on the plugin itself (not just using it), `scripts/dev-run.sh` launches Claude Code with the working tree loaded as a plugin via `claude --plugin-dir "$(pwd)"` — no marketplace install needed. For install-path simulation from a working tree, run `/plugin marketplace add .` inside a Claude Code session.

### Review state location

`/adamsreview:review` writes per-run state (artifact, trace, phase logs, token logs) under `~/.adams-reviews/<repo-slug>/<branch>/<review_id>/`. Override with `export ADAMS_REVIEW_REVIEWS_ROOT=/some/other/path` if you want state elsewhere.

**Why not `~/.claude/reviews/`?** Claude Code hardcodes a sensitive-file permission prompt for writes to `~/.claude/...` that survives even `bypassPermissions` mode, and `~/.claude/reviews` is not on the short list of exempt subdirs (`.claude/commands`, `.claude/agents`, `.claude/skills`). Keeping review state outside `~/.claude/` avoids dozens of permission prompts per run.

**Migrating from pre-Stage-2.5 state.** If you have reviews under `~/.claude/reviews/`, either:

```bash
# Option A: move state to the new canonical root (recommended).
mv ~/.claude/reviews ~/.adams-reviews

# Option B: keep state at the old location via the env var (accepts the prompts).
export ADAMS_REVIEW_REVIEWS_ROOT=~/.claude/reviews
```

### Token counts: what they measure

The rendered report surfaces two numbers:

- **Sub-agent tokens** — rolled up from the per-review `tokens.jsonl` log. Counts every dispatched sub-agent (lenses, validators, fix agents, post-fix reviewer, etc.) for this specific review. Precise.
- **Orchestrator tokens** — rolled up from the Claude Code session transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/`, filtered to assistant turns with `timestamp >= review_started_at`. Captures the main-session spend that `subagent_tokens` deliberately excludes.

The two are complementary, not overlapping. Together they're a good estimate of total cost.

**Orchestrator tokens can over-count.** The filter is time-window only, so any Claude Code turn in the same working directory between `review_started_at` and the last tally gets counted — even if it's unrelated work. In practice that means:

- **Clean:** review → fix back-to-back, or review → new review on updated codebase (each review's `review_started_at` excludes the prior one's turns).
- **Over-counts:** review → unrelated work in the same cwd → fix (the unrelated turns land in the fix run's re-tally).
- **Mitigation:** run the lifecycle commands close together, or do unrelated work in a different worktree (different cwd → different transcript directory → not scanned).

Sub-agent tokens don't have this problem — their log is per-review. If you need a precise total, trust sub-agent tokens and treat orchestrator tokens as a rough ceiling. See `bin/orchestrator-tokens.sh` header for the full list of caveats.

### Why `uv` instead of plain pip

PEP 668 (Python 3.12+ with Homebrew) marks system and user site-packages as externally managed and refuses direct `pip install`. The original plan assumed plain pip; `uv`'s inline-script dep spec is the cleanest workaround: each Python helper is self-contained, runs without activation ceremony, and its dep list lives next to the code that imports it. Tradeoff: requires `uv` on the machine running the scripts.

```

No symlinks, no install script. The plugin runtime discovers `commands/`, `fragments/`, `bin/`, and `hooks/` by convention once the plugin is installed via `/plugin install adamsreview@adamsreview`.

## Troubleshooting

### First invocation is slow

The Python helpers (`artifact-patch.py`, `artifact-render.py`) use a PEP 723 inline-script shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`). On a fresh machine, the first run pauses for a few seconds while `uv` resolves a matching Python interpreter and fetches the `jsonschema` dep into its cache. Subsequent runs hit the cache and are effectively instant. This is a one-time cost per machine, not per review.

### `--ensemble` mode requirements

`/adamsreview:review --ensemble` additionally requires the `codex` and `coderabbit` CLIs installed as Claude Code plugins (not standalone CLIs on `$PATH`). Phase 1.5 dispatches `codex:codex-rescue` and `coderabbit:code-reviewer` through the ensemble adapter; without both plugins present, the run errors at the adapter step. The default (non-ensemble) mode has no such requirement.

### Windows: Git Bash not found

Claude Code auto-discovers Git Bash on Windows and routes `#!/usr/bin/env bash` helpers through it. If the auto-discovery fails (non-default Git Bash install path, portable install, etc.), set `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` to the absolute path of `bash.exe` before launching Claude Code — for example:

```
set CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH=C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe
```

or the `$env:CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH = ...` equivalent in PowerShell.

## Status

`/adamsreview:review`, `/adamsreview:add`, `/adamsreview:walkthrough`, `/adamsreview:fix`, and `/adamsreview:promote` are all built and in use. Stages 1, 2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, and 3 closed between 2026-04-17 and 2026-04-18 (see `docs/archive/BUILD.md` for the full history); walkthrough merged 2026-04-19 from branch `walkthrough-mode`; `/adamsreview:add` was added 2026-04-20 on branch `review-add` (plan: `plans/review-add.md`); plugin conversion (repackaging as a Claude Code plugin, `/adams-review-<stem>` → `/adamsreview:<stem>` namespacing) landed on branch `plugin-conversion` (plan: `plans/plugin-conversion-execution.md`). The only unexecuted scope from the original roadmap is Stage 4 (fragment shrink — `plans/stage-4-fragment-shrink.md`), still pending plan approval.
