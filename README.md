# adams-review

Build repo for two personal Claude Code slash commands:

- **`/adams-review`** — multi-lens code review of a branch or PR (phases 0–6).
- **`/adams-review-fix`** — automated fix loop for auto-fixable findings surfaced by `/adams-review` (phases 7–9).

Both commands live under `commands/_shared/` and are consumed from `~/.claude/commands/` via symlink (see *Layout* below).

## Documents

- **`DESIGN.md`** — normative design (rev 8). Read sections relevant to the stage you're working on; skim the rest.
- **`BUILD.md`** — running build journal. Read this first when starting a fresh session. "Current state" at the top tells you where we are; the stage index shows status of each stage.
- **`plans/`** — per-stage plan files, drafted in plan mode before each stage executes.

## Dependencies

### Runtime

| Tool | Version | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uv` | 0.7+ | `artifact-patch.py`, `artifact-render.py` | `brew install uv`. Scripts use a PEP 723 inline-script shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`) so `uv` fetches and caches `jsonschema` on first run — no venv, no global pip install |
| `python3` | 3.10+ | invoked by `uv` | `uv` will install a matching Python if needed |
| `bash` | 4+ | all `*.sh` helpers | macOS default `/bin/bash` is 3.2 — scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and rely on `brew install bash` or the user's newer default |
| `jq` | 1.6+ | `artifact-read.sh`, log helpers | `brew install jq` |
| `gh` | 2.x | `artifact-publish.sh`, `external-scrape.sh` | `brew install gh`, `gh auth login` |
| `git` | 2.x | everywhere | standard |

### Setup

```bash
# One-time symlink so Claude Code sees the shared dir at its canonical path.
# The repo is the source of truth; ~/.claude/commands/_shared just points at it.
ln -s ~/Projects/adams-review/commands/_shared ~/.claude/commands/_shared
```

No separate Python dep install. First invocation of any `*.py` helper triggers `uv` to resolve `jsonschema` (or any other declared dep) and cache it. Subsequent runs are fast.

Verify:

```bash
readlink ~/.claude/commands/_shared   # should print the repo path
uv --version                          # 0.7+
```

### Why `uv` instead of plain pip

PEP 668 (Python 3.12+ with Homebrew) marks system and user site-packages as externally managed and refuses direct `pip install`. The original plan assumed plain pip; `uv`'s inline-script dep spec is the cleanest workaround: each Python helper is self-contained, runs without activation ceremony, and its dep list lives next to the code that imports it. Tradeoff: requires `uv` on the machine running the scripts.

```

The top-level command files (`~/.claude/commands/adams-review.md`, `adams-review-fix.md`) are added in Stages 2 and 3.

## Status

Stage 1 (Foundation) in progress. See `BUILD.md` for current state.
