# matthewsreview

Multi-stage code review for **Claude Code, Codex, and Oh My Pi** — parallel sub-agent detection, validation passes, per-stage model selection, persistent JSON state, and an automated fix loop that re-reviews and reverts regressions before committing.

Fork of [adamsreview](https://github.com/adamjgmiller/adamsreview) (v0.4.3), expanded: runs from three harnesses instead of one, every pipeline stage's model is configurable, and the pipeline is tuned from ~100 real review runs' telemetry.

The six commands:

- **`review`** — multi-lens code review of a branch or PR. Up to seven parallel sub-agent lenses (correctness, security, UX, etc.) feed a dedup pass, a cheap-then-deep validation gate, and a holistic cross-cutting pass. High-confidence auto-fix proposals are pre-computed so `fix` and `walkthrough` can batch-accept them in one confirm. `--ensemble` adds a Codex pass and PR bot-comment scrape on top of the internal lenses; `--full` forces every lens even on small/docs-only diffs.
- **`codex-review`** — Codex-driven peer to `review`. Same artifact shape, drop-in for everything downstream. Effort tunable via `--effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max|ultra` (default `high`).
- **`add`** — inject externally-sourced findings (a cloud `/ultrareview` paste, an Opus once-over, a teammate's note) into the most recent review's artifact. Deduped, validated by the same gates, re-published to the existing PR comment.
- **`walkthrough`** — interactive driver for findings `fix` would skip. Per-finding briefing + options + recommendation; promote what you want auto-fixed.
- **`fix`** — automated fix loop. Per-fix-group agents, post-fix review, **reverts regressions, commits survivors** (`--granular-commits` for one commit per group).
- **`promote`** — human override that promotes a single finding to auto-fixable.

## Install

| Harness | Install | Invoke |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add mwksl/matthewsreview` then `/plugin install matthewsreview@matthewsreview` | `/matthewsreview:review` |
| Oh My Pi | `omp plugin marketplace add mwksl/matthewsreview` then `omp plugin install matthewsreview@matthewsreview` — **or zero-install**: if the plugin is already installed in Claude Code, omp discovers it automatically | `/matthewsreview:review` |
| Codex | clone, then `./install.sh --codex` (generates skills into `~/.agents/skills/`) | `$matthewsreview-review` |

Runtime deps (all harnesses): `uv`, `jq`, `gh`, `git`, bash 3.2+. Run `bin/doctor.sh` after install — it checks deps, harness CLIs, config validity, and stale pre-rename remnants, printing the exact fix for anything off.

### Local checkout installs

- **Claude Code**: `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/matthewsreview` then `/plugin install matthewsreview@matthewsreview`; or one-shot `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/matthewsreview`.
- **Oh My Pi**: `omp plugin marketplace add /path/to/matthewsreview` then `omp plugin install matthewsreview@matthewsreview`.
- **Codex**: `./install.sh --codex` from the clone. Re-run after moving or updating the clone (generated skills bake an absolute `MREVIEW_ROOT`).

## Recommended flow

1. **Review.** `/matthewsreview:review --ensemble --full` (the daily-driver combination: full lens coverage + pooled Codex/bot-comment sources). Or `codex-review` for a Codex-driven pass.
2. **Add** *(optional)* — inject findings from a parallel review.
3. **Walkthrough** *(optional)* — the review's **Next steps** block tells you exactly how many findings need human judgment.
4. **Fix** — applies every auto-eligible finding (including walkthrough-promoted ones).

Each command is independent; steps 2–4 can land days or weeks after step 1 — review state persists under `~/.matthews-reviews/<repo-slug>/<branch>/<review_id>/`.

## Model selection

Every sub-agent dispatches through a named **role**; you choose the model per role. Role strings are `engine:model[:effort]`:

- **Engines**: `claude` (native in Claude Code/omp sessions), `codex` (CLI subprocess, billed by Codex), `omp` (any omp provider model, native in omp only).
- **Tiers** hold the defaults: `deep=claude:opus` (deep lenses, deep validation, cross-cutting, fix agents, post-fix review), `light=claude:sonnet` (light lenses/validation), `utility=claude:sonnet` (classifier, normalizer, dedup, scoring, fix-hint, briefer, drafter). Codex lanes (`ensemble_detect`, `codex_detect/validate/crosscut`) default `codex::high`.
- **Overrides**: any role individually, e.g. `deep_validate=claude:sonnet`, `light=codex::medium`, `utility=claude:haiku`.

Where config lives (later wins): built-in defaults → `~/.matthews-reviews/config.json` → `<repo>/.matthewsreview.json` → `--profile <name>` → `--models "<csv>"`.

```jsonc
// ~/.matthews-reviews/config.json
{
  "tiers": { "utility": "claude:haiku" },
  "roles": { "deep_validate": "claude:sonnet" },
  "gates": { "phase3_gate": 45, "phase4_bands": [45, 60, 75], "fix_threshold": 60, "walkthrough_threshold": 60 },
  "profiles": {
    "max":   { "tiers": { "light": "claude:opus" } },
    "cheap": { "tiers": { "utility": "claude:haiku", "light": "claude:haiku" } }
  }
}
```

```bash
/matthewsreview:review --full --models "utility=claude:haiku"
/matthewsreview:review --profile cheap
```

The preflight prints the resolved **Model plan** table (role / engine / model / effort / source) before any sub-agent launches; the plan is stored in the artifact (`model_plan`) and each dispatch's role string lands in `tokens.jsonl`. The effort segment is codex-only (`low|medium|high|xhigh|max|ultra`).

### Gate thresholds

Score gates are config values with unchanged defaults: `phase3_gate=45`, `phase4_bands=[45,60,75]`, `fix_threshold=60`, `walkthrough_threshold=60`. `bin/calibration-report.py ~/.matthews-reviews` aggregates your review history (demote rates, waste ratios, band→disposition matrix, per-phase token medians) so you can tune them from evidence. CLI thresholds on `fix`/`walkthrough` still override per run.

## The artifact as a work queue

- **Dispositions export** — one row per finding with suggested actions, replacing hand-built ENGAGE/SKIP passes:
  ```bash
  bin/artifact-render.py --input <review_dir>/artifact.json --format dispositions > DISPOSITIONS.md
  ```
- **Calibration** — `bin/calibration-report.py` (see above).
- **Doctor** — `bin/doctor.sh` for environment problems.

## Command reference

```

## Maintenance

- **Version bumps**: patch for fixes, minor for new commands or breaking output-shape changes — bump `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or `/plugin marketplace update` / `omp plugin upgrade` won't pick up changes.
- **CI**: `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` runs `test/smoke.sh` (361 assertions) on ubuntu + macOS, plus shellcheck and a bash-3.2 portability gate. Run `test/smoke.sh` locally before pushing.
- **Upgrading**: Claude Code `/plugin marketplace update matthewsreview && /plugin update`; omp `omp plugin upgrade matthewsreview@matthewsreview`; Codex `git pull && ./install.sh --codex`.
- **Working on the pipeline itself**: read `AGENTS.md` first. `docs/state-and-gates.md` (state model, gates, lanes) is the normative spec; `docs/pipeline.md` has phase trees; `docs/helpers.md` the helper inventory.

## Migrating from adamsreview

The pipeline reads the old identity's state with a migration nudge, so nothing breaks mid-transition:

1. `mv ~/.adams-reviews ~/.matthews-reviews` (or keep the old root via `MATTHEWS_REVIEW_REVIEWS_ROOT=~/.adams-reviews`).
2. Rename any `ADAMS_REVIEW_*` exports to `MATTHEWS_REVIEW_*` (old vars still work as fallbacks).
3. In Claude Code: `/plugin uninstall adamsreview@adamsreview`, then install matthewsreview. Update any project `.claude/settings.json` `enabledPlugins` entries from `adamsreview@adamsreview` to `matthewsreview@matthewsreview`, and delete stale `plugins/cache/adamsreview/.../bin` PATH allowlist lines in `settings.local.json`.
4. `bin/doctor.sh` flags anything you missed.

## Troubleshooting

- **First helper invocation is slow** — `uv` resolves Python + `jsonschema` on first run per machine; cached thereafter.
- **`omp` sessions show `--tokens null` rows** — the eval bridge doesn't always expose sub-agent usage; logged as null rather than estimated. Codex dispatches report real counts from `token_count` events.
- **Codex skills stopped working after moving the clone** — re-run `./install.sh --codex` (absolute paths are baked).
- **Reviews root moved** — `~/.matthews-reviews` is canonical; `MATTHEWS_REVIEW_REVIEWS_ROOT` overrides; `~/.adams-reviews` still works read-side with a migrate warning.

## Status

Current release: **v1.0.0** — rebrand + multi-harness (Claude Code / Codex / Oh My Pi), per-stage model selection, efficiency pass informed by 98 real review runs. Fork of adamsreview v0.4.3 by Adam Miller.
