### ⚠ Requires manual attention (1)

_Not auto-applied by `/matthewsreview:fix` directly — these need a confirmation step. Findings with an auto-recommendation get batch-confirmed at `:fix`'s Phase 7.5 preflight (or `:walkthrough` Step 4.5); use `/matthewsreview:promote <finding_id>` for a single-finding manual override._

| # | Score | Impact | File | Issue | Why manual |
|---|-------|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| F002 | 78 | correctness | `src/billing/invoice.ts:55-80` | Partial-refund branch incomplete | design decision; needs product input |

### ℹ Uncertain (1)

| # | Score | Impact | File | Issue |
|---|-------|--------|------|-------|
| F003 | 55 | correctness | `src/api/search.ts:33` | Query string possibly not escaped |

Phase 4 couldn't confirm decisively. Re-run `/matthewsreview:review` if you suspect this deserves
further investigation with fresh context.

## Light lane — ux, policy, architecture

_Light-lane findings — including rows labeled auto-fixable — aren't applied by `/matthewsreview:fix` directly. Findings with an auto-recommendation get batch-confirmed at `:fix`'s Phase 7.5 preflight (or `:walkthrough` Step 4.5); use `/matthewsreview:promote <finding_id>` for a single-finding manual override._

| # | Score | Impact | File | Finding | Disposition |
|---|-------|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| F004 | 60 | ux | `src/components/DeleteButton.tsx:12` | Missing loading state on destructive action | auto-fixable |
| F006 | 48 | architecture | `src/models/preferences.ts:15-22` | Deprecated pattern used in new code path | uncertain |

## Pre-existing — report-only (1)

Shown only when `origin_confidence: high`. Never auto-fixed in v1 (§13.1 pre-existing override).

| # | Score | File | Finding | Follow-up |
|---|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| F005 | 70 | `src/models/user.ts:12` | No index on `email` | File as separate issue |
