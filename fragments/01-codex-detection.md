## Phase 1 — Codex detection (codex-review)

Capture `phase_1_start_epoch=$(date +%s)` as the FIRST action of this
phase (step 1.6 logs the elapsed time). Initialize the tracking
variables Phase 1's summary will reference:

- `lenses_run=""` — comma-separated list of lens IDs that successfully
  produced output (filled in across §1.4).
- `lenses_dropped=""` — comma-separated list of lenses that hit the
  unrecoverable retry path.
- `candidate_count=0` — total candidates the normalizer emitted, set
  after §1.5.2's batched `--add-findings` returns.

This fragment is the codex-review counterpart to `fragments/01-detection.md`.
Where the canonical fragment dispatches 6–7 Claude `Agent` blocks (one per
lens), this fragment dispatches 7 parallel **Codex jobs** via the
`codex-companion.mjs` plugin's `task --background` primitive — captures
each `jobId`, polls to terminal, fetches the freeform output, and feeds
all 7 outputs into one **Sonnet normalizer** that emits the standard
candidate JSON shape.

Phases 0, 2, 3, and 6 are unchanged — codex-review reuses
`fragments/00-preflight.md`, `fragments/03-dedup.md`,
`fragments/04-scoring-gate.md`, `fragments/07-finalize.md` verbatim.
Phases 4 and 5 are also Codex-driven; see
`fragments/05-codex-validation.md` and
`fragments/06-codex-cross-cutting.md`.

### 1.1. Decide which lenses run

Based on the Phase 0 working-context values, build the lens dispatch
list. Codex-review always runs L7 (the holistic safety net) when not
in trivial mode — no `--ensemble` gate, since codex-review IS the
high-thoroughness path.

| Lens | Effort | Runs when |
|---|---|---|
| L1 — diff-local scan | `$effort` | always |
| L2 — structural / blast-radius | `$effort` | `trivial_mode != true` |
| L3 — CLAUDE.md compliance | `$effort` | always |
| L4 — comment compliance | `$effort` | always |
| L5 — UX | `$effort` | `user_facing == true AND trivial_mode != true` |
| L6 — lightweight security | `$effort` | `trivial_mode != true` |
| L7 — holistic review | `$effort` | `trivial_mode != true` |

`$effort` is the working-context value captured from `--effort`
(default `high`).

Skipped lenses get a one-line note in `trace.md`:

```
Phase 1 codex: L7 skipped (trivial_mode=true)
Phase 1 codex: L2/L5/L6/L7 skipped (trivial_mode=true)
```

Log them via `log-phase.sh --summary` at step 1.6 as part of the Phase 1
summary.

### 1.2. Build the shared input

Compute the diff scope once against `$comparison_ref` (per Phase 0 step
0.2a / §13.10):

```bash
git diff "$comparison_ref..HEAD"
```

Codex jobs have filesystem access via codex-companion's `task` mode
and run `git diff` themselves — the prompt body in
`fragments/lens-prompts/L<N>.md` instructs them to read the diff
between `$comparison_ref` and HEAD. The orchestrator does NOT pre-compute
the diff and embed it; Codex's working directory is the repo root and
the diff range is in the prompt's shared invariants (§1.2.1 below).

`$claude_md_paths` (the list captured in Phase 0 step 0.7) is required
for L3, L4, L5 prompts. The orchestrator substitutes the value into
the prompt body at `--prompt-file` write time.

### 1.2.1. Shared lens-prompt invariants

Every Codex job in step 1.3 receives the contents of
`fragments/lens-prompts/_shared-invariants.md` prepended to the
lens-specific prompt body. This is the same shared block consumed by
`fragments/01-detection.md` §1.2.1 — single source of truth for
candidate-shape requirements (`line_range` rules, origin defaults,
JSON schema).

### 1.2b. Prior-fix suspect scan (§13.11b)

Same deterministic helper as `fragments/01-detection.md` step 1.2b.
The output feeds L2's prompt so L2 can judge prior-fix reversion.

Skipped when `$trivial_mode` is true (L2 is skipped too):

```bash
if [[ "$trivial_mode" != "true" ]]; then
    reviewed_files_csv=$(printf '%s\n' "$reviewed_files_all" \
      | awk 'NF' | paste -sd, -)

    prior_fix_suspects=$(
        prior-fix-diff.sh \
          --comparison-ref "$comparison_ref" \
          --reviewed-files "$reviewed_files_csv" \
          2> >(tee -a "$trace_log_path" >&2)
    ) || prior_fix_suspects="[]"
else
    prior_fix_suspects="[]"
fi
```

On helper non-zero exit, fall back to `[]`.

### 1.2c. Build the Codex prompt files

For each lens that runs (per step 1.1's selection), the orchestrator
assembles a prompt file at `/tmp/matthews-review-codex-<review_id>-L<N>.md`.
Codex's `task --background --prompt-file <path>` reads the file at
launch time, so it must be on disk before §1.3.

The lens-prompt source files (`fragments/lens-prompts/L<N>.md`,
`fragments/lens-prompts/_shared-invariants.md`) live in the plugin's
install directory — NOT in the reviewed repository. Use the **Read
tool** to load them (it resolves plugin-relative paths the same way
`Read fragments/01-codex-detection.md` resolved this fragment when the
top-level command kicked it off). Do NOT use bash `cat` with a
relative path — bash's cwd is the reviewed repo, so a relative path
points at the wrong tree, and there's no canonical `$PLUGIN_ROOT`
shell variable.

Per lens that runs, the orchestrator does:

1. **Read** `fragments/lens-prompts/_shared-invariants.md` once and
   capture its content as `shared_invariants_body`.
2. **Read** `fragments/lens-prompts/L<N>.md` and capture as
   `lens_body_L<N>`.
3. **Substitute placeholders** in both `shared_invariants_body` and
   `lens_body_L<N>` against working-context values from Phase 0 + 1.2b.
   Substitution is literal pattern replacement (no regex; no `&`
   escape semantics).

   In `shared_invariants_body`:

   - `$comparison_ref` → working-context `comparison_ref` (Phase 0 step 0.2a).
   - `$reviewed_sha` → working-context `reviewed_sha` (Phase 0 step 0.10).

   In `lens_body_L<N>`:

   - **L2 only**: `$prior_fix_suspects` → JSON array from step 1.2b.
   - **L3, L5 only**: `$claude_md_paths` → newline-joined list from
     Phase 0 step 0.7.
   - L1, L4, L6, L7: no per-lens placeholders.

   **L1 sharding (large diffs).** When Phase 0's `lines_changed >
   4000`, dispatch L1 as ⌈lines_changed/4000⌉ balanced shards (never
   more than 3), each with its own per-shard diff (`git diff
   $comparison_ref -- <shard files>`) and the suffix "You are
   reviewing shard N of M — only the files in the diff below." Same
   rationale as the `:review` L1 shard rule (30-minute hangs on
   multi-thousand-line PRs); shard outputs merge at the normalizer.

   The orchestrator can perform these substitutions in-context (string
   replace) before writing — no shell needed. If you DO want a shell
   one-liner, bash literal substitution is safe (immune to `&` /
   backreferences, unlike `awk gsub` / `sed`):

   ```bash
   shared_invariants_body="${shared_invariants_body//\$comparison_ref/$comparison_ref}"
   shared_invariants_body="${shared_invariants_body//\$reviewed_sha/$reviewed_sha}"
   lens_body="${lens_body//\$prior_fix_suspects/$prior_fix_suspects}"  # L2
   lens_body="${lens_body//\$claude_md_paths/$claude_md_paths}"        # L3, L5
   ```

   The `\$` in the search pattern escapes bash's own `$` expansion —
   the placeholder in the file is the literal four characters `$comparison_ref`.

4. **Write** the assembled prompt to
   `/tmp/matthews-review-codex-${review_id}-L<N>.md`. Use the bash
   `printf` pattern (the Write tool is NOT in
   `commands/codex-review.md`'s `allowed-tools` grant — recommending
   it would trip the runtime's tool-permission check before any Codex
   job launches):

   ```bash
   prompt_file="/tmp/matthews-review-codex-${review_id}-L${N}.md"
   { printf '%s\n\n' "$shared_invariants_body"; \
     printf '%s\n'   "$lens_body"; } > "$prompt_file"
   ```

   `printf '%s'` (NOT `echo`) is required when the body content may
   contain backslashes — `echo` collapses them under zsh / dash /
   `xpg_echo`, mangling JSON escape sequences embedded in the prompt
   (CLAUDE.md operational rule 12).

### 1.3. Dispatch the Codex jobs (one orchestrator turn)

> **One turn for all lens launches — not one turn per lens.** Issue every
> running lens's `node "$CODEX_COMPANION" task --background` Bash block in
> a single orchestrator turn. Phase 1 wall-clock latency is
> `max(codex_durations)`, not `sum(codex_durations)`. Serializing turns
> up to ~7× the runtime budget.

Launch each running lens's Codex job in a SINGLE orchestrator turn so
they run concurrently. Each launch is a Bash tool-use:

```bash
node "$CODEX_COMPANION" task --background --effort "$effort" \
    --prompt-file "/tmp/matthews-review-codex-${review_id}-L${N}.md" \
    --json
```

The companion returns a JSON launch payload on stdout. Extract the id
with `jq -r '.jobId'` and capture into a working-context map keyed by
lens slot:

```bash
codex_job_id=$(node "$CODEX_COMPANION" task --background --effort "$effort" \
    --prompt-file "/tmp/matthews-review-codex-${review_id}-L${N}.md" \
    --json | jq -r '.jobId')
```

Working-context map shape:

```
codex_job_ids = {
  "L1": "<jobId>",
  "L2": "<jobId>",
  ...
}
```

Skipped lenses are absent from the map. Lenses that fail the launch
itself (codex-companion exit != 0, or `.jobId` empty) are logged to
`trace.md` with tag `phase_1_codex_launch_failed:L<N>` and dropped
from the map; they proceed to the §1.4 retry-or-escalate path with a
synthetic "launch failed" status.

**Tracking**: every lens that successfully receives a `jobId` joins
the `codex_job_ids` map; this is the working-context source of truth
for what's in flight. The §1.6 summary's `lenses_run` and
`lenses_dropped` lists are filled in across §1.4 as jobs resolve.

### 1.4. Poll the Codex jobs (subsequent orchestrator turns)

> **One turn for all in-flight polls — not one turn per job.** Issue every
> still-alive job's `codex-poll.sh` Bash block in the same orchestrator
> turn (and re-poll the still-alive ones together on the next turn).
> Polling one job per turn turns the 90s stall-detection cadence into
> N×90s and silently lengthens the phase by an order of magnitude on
> wide fan-outs.

For each `jobId` in the map, poll via the watchdog helper:

```bash
case "$effort" in
    low)    ceiling=300 ;;    # 5 min
    medium) ceiling=480 ;;    # 8 min
    high)   ceiling=900 ;;    # 15 min
    xhigh)  ceiling=1500 ;;   # 25 min
    max)    ceiling=2100 ;;   # 35 min
    ultra)  ceiling=2700 ;;   # 45 min
    *)      ceiling=900 ;;
esac
# Size scaling (observed: a 10.7k-line PR needed manual deadline
# extension): base + 60s per 1,000 changed lines, capped at 2x base.
size_bonus=$(( 60 * lines_changed / 1000 ))
ceiling=$(( ceiling + size_bonus ))
case "$effort" in
    low)   max_ceiling=600 ;;
    medium) max_ceiling=960 ;;
    high)  max_ceiling=1800 ;;
    xhigh) max_ceiling=3000 ;;
    max)   max_ceiling=4200 ;;
    ultra) max_ceiling=5400 ;;
    *)     max_ceiling=1800 ;;
esac
[[ "$ceiling" -gt "$max_ceiling" ]] && ceiling=$max_ceiling

poll=$(codex-poll.sh \
        --job "$job_id" \
        --companion "$CODEX_COMPANION" \
        --stall-threshold-sec 90 \
        --wall-clock-ceiling-sec "$ceiling")
verdict=$(printf '%s' "$poll" | jq -r '.verdict')
```

`codex-poll.sh` wraps `node "$CODEX_COMPANION" status --json` with a
two-signal liveness check (logFile mtime + `result --json` desync
probe) plus a wall-clock ceiling. See `bin/codex-poll.sh` and
`plans/codex-watchdog.md` for the bug class — direct calls to
`node "$CODEX_COMPANION" status` are forbidden in this fragment
(smoke `CR-13c` enforces).

Each call emits one verdict per `jobId`:

| verdict | meaning | next action |
|---|---|---|
| `alive` | broker says running; logFile fresh | keep polling next turn |
| `stalled_suspect` | logFile stale > 90s but broker still coherent | keep polling next turn |
| `broker_desynced` | broker says running, disk store says "No job found" — confirmed dead | cancel + §3.7 retry |
| `wall_clock_exceeded` | elapsed > effort-derived ceiling | cancel + §3.7 retry |
| `completed` | terminal; `raw_output` is in the verdict | consume `raw_output`, exit poll loop |
| `failed_terminal` | terminal `failed` / `cancelled` | §3.7 retry |

Poll all jobs in one orchestrator turn (multiple Bash blocks, each
polling a different job) until all are terminal. Claude Code's
between-turn cadence provides natural pacing — no explicit sleep
between turns.

When verdict is `broker_desynced` or `wall_clock_exceeded`, cancel
the job before routing into §3.7's retry path. Cancel is
fire-and-forget — its outcome doesn't gate the next step, and the
wall-clock-ceiling logic in `codex-poll.sh` re-fires regardless on
the next poll. Background + `disown` is Bash 3.2-portable; `timeout`
is GNU coreutils and isn't on stock macOS:

```bash
( node "$CODEX_COMPANION" cancel "$job_id" >/dev/null 2>&1 ) & disown
elapsed_for_log=$(printf '%s' "$poll" | jq -r '.elapsed_sec // "null"')
printf 'phase_1_codex_watchdog: lens=L<N> verdict=%s job=%s elapsed=%s\n' \
    "$verdict" "$job_id" "$elapsed_for_log" >> "$trace_log_path"
# fall through to §3.7 retry-with-orchestrator-judgment
```

When verdict is `completed`, the `raw_output` field IS the freeform
Codex stdout — the helper has already plucked
`.storedJob.result.rawOutput` (with the documented
`// .storedJob.payload.rawOutput // .storedJob.rawOutput // ""`
fallback chain) so this fragment doesn't repeat the result fetch:

```bash
codex_output_L<N>=$(printf '%s' "$poll" | jq -r '.raw_output')
```

Capture as `codex_output_L<N>`. An empty `raw_output` on a `completed`
verdict still routes to the §3.7 retry path (the existing "completed
but malformed" branch).

#### Retry-with-orchestrator-judgment (per plan §3.7)

For each job, when the terminal state is `failed` / `cancelled`, OR
when `state == completed` but the output looks malformed (empty,
clearly truncated, doesn't resemble candidate-list output even loosely),
the orchestrator inspects the failure context and decides:

1. **Likely transient** (rate limit, transient API error, single-output
   JSON glitch, sentinel mismatch): retry up to **3 times** with the
   same prompt file. Re-launch via `task --background --effort
   "$effort" --prompt-file "$prompt_file"`, capture the new jobId, poll
   again.
2. **Persistent or fundamental** (3 retries with the same failure mode,
   or a clear structural error like "prompt file unreadable"): treat as
   unrecoverable. Log to `trace.md` with tag `phase_1_codex_dropped:L<N>
   reason=<short cause>`.

When any lens is dropped, ASK ONCE for the whole
phase (don't ask per-lens — that's ~7 prompts):

```
"<N> Codex lenses failed after retry: [L<N>, L<M>, ...]. Continue
with the remaining lenses (degraded coverage), or abort the run?"
Options:
- Continue — proceed to Phase 2 with surviving lenses
- Abort — exit cleanly; preserve the seeded artifact for inspection
```

If 0 lenses survive, abort automatically (no point asking). On Continue,
log `phase_1_codex_user_continued: surviving=L1,L3,L4` and proceed.

**Tracking finalize (end of §1.4)**: after all jobs have either
resolved successfully or been dropped, set:

- `lenses_run` = comma-separated lens IDs whose Codex output was
  successfully fetched (e.g. `L1,L3,L4,L5,L6,L7`).
- `lenses_dropped` = comma-separated lens IDs that hit the unrecoverable
  retry path (e.g. `L2`). Empty string if none.

These feed §1.6's summary line.

### 1.5. Normalize Codex outputs (single Sonnet sub-agent)

Once all Codex jobs are terminal (and any drops handled), dispatch ONE
Sonnet `Agent` to consolidate the outputs into the standard candidate
schema. Mirrors the Phase 1.5 ensemble adapter pattern at
`fragments/02-ensemble-adapter.md` §1.5.5.

Concatenate all surviving lens outputs with lens-id headers:

```
=== L1 (diff-local) ===
<contents of codex_output_L1>

=== L2 (structural) ===
<contents of codex_output_L2>

...
```

Dispatch with role `normalizer` (default claude:sonnet),
`subagent_type: general-purpose`.
Prompt essence:

> You are normalizing 7 (or fewer if any were skipped/dropped) Codex
> lens outputs into the matthewsreview candidate schema. Each output is
> freeform Markdown/text describing findings; your job is to extract
> concrete candidates and tag them with the lens that produced them.
>

Capture the normalizer's raw output as `normalizer_output`. Log tokens:

```bash
log-tokens.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase phase_1 \
  --agent-role codex_normalizer --agent-id <id> \
  --model "$role_normalizer" --tokens <N or null>
```

### 1.5.1. Parse + repair + schema-guard

Pipe `$normalizer_output` through `parse-with-repair.py`, then type-guard
before iterating:

```bash
normalizer_clean=$(printf '%s' "$normalizer_output" \
    | parse-with-repair.py 2> >(tee -a "$trace_log_path" >&2))

if [[ -z "$normalizer_clean" ]]; then
    printf 'phase_1_codex_normalizer_unparseable: dropping all internal candidates\n' \
        >> "$trace_log_path"
    internal_candidates="[]"
else
    # Type-guard the normalizer output. Sonnet sometimes wraps the
    # array in `{"findings": [...]}` or `{"candidates": [...]}`; pluck
    # those before iterating. If the result is still not an array,
    # treat as unparseable rather than letting jq's `[ .[] | ... ]`
    # crash the phase.
    normalizer_array=$(printf '%s' "$normalizer_clean" | jq -c '
      if type == "array" then .
      elif type == "object" and (.findings | type == "array") then .findings
      elif type == "object" and (.candidates | type == "array") then .candidates
      else null end
    ')
    if [[ "$normalizer_array" == "null" ]] || [[ -z "$normalizer_array" ]]; then
        printf 'phase_1_codex_normalizer_not_array: normalizer returned non-array (no .findings/.candidates pluck possible); dropping internal candidates\n' \
            >> "$trace_log_path"
        internal_candidates="[]"
    else
        # Schema-guard repair for missing location info — schema requires
        # file non-null and line_range as [int,int] with items >= 1.
        # Drop non-object array elements first: a normalizer that returned
        # `["no findings"]` or `[{...}, "extra prose"]` would otherwise
        # reach the `. + {file: ...}` projection and crash jq with "string
        # and object cannot be added", killing the entire phase. Count
        # drops for trace + §1.6 summary visibility.
        _norm_in_count=$(printf '%s' "$normalizer_array" | jq 'length')
        internal_candidates=$(printf '%s' "$normalizer_array" | jq -c '
          [ .[]
            | select(type == "object")
            | . + {
                file:       (.file // "(unknown)"),
                line_range: (.line_range // [1,1])
              }
          ]
        ')
        _norm_out_count=$(printf '%s' "$internal_candidates" | jq 'length')
        if (( _norm_out_count < _norm_in_count )); then
            printf 'phase_1_codex_normalizer_non_object_dropped: input=%d kept=%d dropped=%d\n' \
                "$_norm_in_count" "$_norm_out_count" "$((_norm_in_count - _norm_out_count))" \
                >> "$trace_log_path"
        fi
    fi
fi
```

Log a one-line `trace.md` note per repaired candidate (file/line_range
sentinel applied) so the user knows where the ambiguity came from.

### 1.5.2. Join + assign IDs + post-processing + batched add-findings

Same shape (and same ordering — IDs are assigned AFTER bad candidates
are dropped, so no ID gaps remain in the artifact) as
`fragments/01-detection.md` §1.5 join step:

1. Pass `$internal_candidates` through `line-range-check.sh` to drop
   any line-range hallucinations exceeding the file at `$reviewed_sha`,
   and any candidates citing files missing in the reviewed tree. Done
   FIRST so dropped candidates don't consume monotonic IDs.
2. Pass through `assign-finding-ids.sh` to assign monotonic `F0NN`
   IDs to the surviving candidates.
3. Pass through `origin-crosscheck.sh` to blame-correct each
   candidate's `origin` / `origin_confidence` per §13.11.
4. Commit via one batched `artifact-patch.py --add-findings <array>`
   call (atomic write across the whole accepted batch).

Refer to `fragments/01-detection.md` §1.5 for the exact jq/source-family
canonicalization scaffolding — codex-review uses the same helpers and
the same join step. The only difference is the candidate origin: instead
of being pooled from per-lens `Agent` outputs, they come from the
single combined Sonnet normalizer above. The post-processing chain is
identical.

**Capture `candidate_count`** after `--add-findings` returns so §1.6's
log line and `phases.jsonl` record have the right number:

```bash
candidate_count=$(artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" \
  --filter '.findings | length')
```

(Reads the post-`--add-findings` count rather than the pre-batched
candidate count, so rejected entries — preflight drops, dedup
collisions — are excluded.)

### 1.5.3. Clean up Codex prompt files

```bash
rm -f "/tmp/matthews-review-codex-${review_id}-L"*.md \
      "/tmp/matthews-review-codex-${review_id}-L"*.out.json
```

Any orchestrator-fatal failure before this point leaves the prompt
files in /tmp for post-mortem inspection — the §1.4 retry-with-judgment
path drops affected lenses cleanly so this cleanup runs on success.

### 1.6. Log Phase 1 summary

```bash
phase_1_elapsed=$(( $(date +%s) - phase_1_start_epoch ))

# Surface the §1.5.1 normalizer drop count so a non-object array element
# (parseable but wrong-shape) shows up in the rendered phase summary
# rather than only in trace.md. Zero on a healthy run.

`$lenses_run` is the comma-separated list of surviving lens IDs (e.g.
`L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6,L7` for a full review, `L1,L3,L4` for trivial mode).
`$lenses_dropped` is the comma-separated list of lenses that hit the
unrecoverable retry path (empty string when none).
