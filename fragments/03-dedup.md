## Phase 2 — Dedup (LLM-only)

A single Sonnet sub-agent groups near-duplicate candidates so one
underlying issue doesn't surface as multiple findings downstream.
No structural fingerprinting — one LLM pass, pennies of cost.

Capture `phase_2_start_epoch=$(date +%s)` and `pre_dedup_count=$(
artifact-read.sh --path "$artifact_path" \
  --filter '.findings | length')` as the first actions of this phase —
step 2.4 references both.

### 2.1. Build the dedup input

Read the current findings list:

```bash
artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" \
  --filter '[.findings[] | {id, file, line_range, claim, source_families, sources}]'
```

Capture as `candidate_list_json`.

If `candidate_list_json` is `[]` (no candidates from Phase 1 + 1.5), skip
Phase 2 entirely — log "Phase 2 skipped (no candidates)" to `trace.md`.

### 2.2. Dispatch the Sonnet dedup sub-agent

Launch one sub-agent with role `dedup` (default claude:sonnet).
Prompt essence:

> Group these candidate findings into sets where each set represents the
> same underlying issue described in different language.
>
> Candidates (JSON):
>
> ```
> <candidate_list_json>
> ```
>
> Rules:
> - Two candidates belong in the same group only when they point at the
>   same underlying behavior. "Authenticate returns null" and "session.ts
>   doesn't handle DB failure" at the same call site → same group.
>   Candidates about overlapping code but describing distinct issues →
>   separate groups.
> - **Be conservative — prefer splitting when unsure.** False merging
>   hides findings; false splitting only produces two near-identical
>   entries, which the report already handles gracefully.
> - Every id must appear in exactly one group. Single-id groups (unique
>   candidates) are fine.
>
> Return JSON: `{"groups": [[id, id, ...], [id, ...], ...]}`.

Log tokens with every required arg spelled out (the helper's argparse
refuses short forms):

```bash
log-tokens.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" \
  --phase phase_2 \
  --agent-role dedup \
  --agent-id "$dedup_agent_id" \
  --model "$role_dedup" \
  --tokens "$dedup_tokens_or_null"
```

Capture `dedup_agent_id` from the Agent tool result; `dedup_tokens_or_null`
is the parsed token count or the literal word `null` on parse failure.

### 2.3. Merge each group in the artifact

For each group:

**Group of size 1 (unique candidate)** — do nothing; the lone id stays
as-is.

**Group of size ≥ 2** — pick the first id as the "keeper". Union the
`sources` and `source_families` arrays across all group members into
the keeper. Reconcile the three routing fields that can disagree
across group members. Delete every non-keeper.

**Routing-field reconciliation rules** (applied to the keeper after
the array union, before deleting the dupes):

- `origin_confidence`:
  - **If the keeper's `origin == "introduced_by_pr"`**: take the
    HIGHEST across the group (`high` > `medium` > `low`). Corroborating
    PR-caused signals raise confidence — the standard case.
  - **If the keeper's `origin == "pre_existing"`**: two-stage rule.
    **C1: Same-origin lowest.** Take the LOWEST `origin_confidence`
    across all `pre_existing`-origin members of the group. The signal
    lives at the *group* level, not the keeper level — if any
    `pre_existing` member arrived as a corrective `medium` (from
    `origin-crosscheck.sh`'s main path A2 downgrade — lens said
    `introduced_by_pr` but blame is fully ancestor of
    `$comparison_ref`, or lens said `pre_existing/high` but blame
    sees PR commits), the group as a whole is uncertain and §13.1
    should not fire. **C2: Cross-origin cap.** If C1's lowest is
    still `high` (all `pre_existing` members agreed at high) AND any
    group member has a non-`pre_existing` origin, cap `max_conf` at
    `medium`. The cross-origin disagreement (one lens classified the
    finding as PR-caused, another as pre-existing — same underlying
    bug) is itself signal of group-level origin uncertainty,
    independent of the individual confidence levels. Without the cap,
    a group like `[pre_existing/high keeper, introduced_by_pr/high
    sibling]` keeps `max_conf=high` (C1 filters to pre_existing-only
    so the introduced_by_pr sibling is invisible to C1), `keeper.origin`
    stays `pre_existing` per the unchanged "leave `origin` on keeper"
    rule, and §13.1 fires — re-creating the routed-to-footnote bug
    in a third order-dependent disguise. Together C1 + C2 make the
    pre_existing branch fully order-independent: §13.1 cannot fire on
    any dedup group containing same-origin `medium` evidence OR
    cross-origin disagreement, regardless of which member became keeper.
    Trade-off: a legitimate rename-follow `pre_existing/high` keeper
    (the F038-class extraction override that survived A2) gets
    demoted to `medium` when grouped with any `pre_existing/medium`
    sibling (C1) or any non-`pre_existing` sibling (C2), and routes
    through Phase 3 + Phase 4 instead of the §13.1 footnote. Phase 4
    re-validates and the extraction trace typically re-confirms the
    finding as pre-existing — the recall cost is bounded, and it's
    the right place to do that confirmation when sibling signal
    disagrees. Single-id groups (no siblings, no reconciliation runs)
    preserve the rename-follow override untouched.
- `validation_lane`: `deep` wins over `light` if any group member is
  deep. Safer routing — deep validation of a potentially-light issue
  costs more tokens, but light validation of a deep issue risks
  missing blast radius.
- `actionability`: `auto_fixable` > `manual` > `report_only` (most-
  actionable wins). Corroborating evidence tends to sharpen
  actionability.

Leave `impact_type` and `origin` on the keeper — those rarely vary
meaningfully across duplicate candidates and picking a merge rule is
not worth the complexity.

Concretely, for each group `[K, D1, D2, ...]` (K = keeper, Di = dupes):

1. Read the current state of every id in the group:

    ```bash
    artifact-read.sh \
      --path "$artifact_path" \
      --filter '[.findings[] | select(.id as $id | ["K","D1","D2"] | index($id))]'
    ```

    (Substitute the actual group ids.)

2. Compute union arrays via `jq`:

    ```bash
    union_sources=$(jq -c '[.[].sources[]] | unique' <<<"$group_json")
    union_families=$(jq -c '[.[].source_families[]] | unique' <<<"$group_json")
    ```

3. Compute the reconciled routing-field values across the group.
   The lookup objects use string keys (jq object keys must be strings)
   and `sort_by ... | last` picks the highest-ranked value deterministically:

    ```bash
    # Read the keeper's current origin (substitute actual keeper id for "K").
    keeper_origin=$(jq -r --arg kid "K" \
      '.[] | select(.id==$kid) | .origin' <<<"$group_json")

    # origin_confidence reconciliation — see prose rule above.
    if [ "$keeper_origin" = "pre_existing" ]; then
        # C1: lowest across pre_existing members
        max_conf=$(jq -r '
          [.[] | select(.origin == "pre_existing") | .origin_confidence]
          | sort_by({"low":1, "medium":2, "high":3}[.]) | first
        ' <<<"$group_json")
        # C2: cap to medium on cross-origin disagreement.
        if [ "$max_conf" = "high" ]; then
            has_cross_origin=$(jq -r \
              'any(.[].origin; . != "pre_existing")' <<<"$group_json")
            if [ "$has_cross_origin" = "true" ]; then
                max_conf="medium"
            fi
        fi
    else
        max_conf=$(jq -r '
          [.[].origin_confidence]
          | sort_by({"low":1, "medium":2, "high":3}[.]) | last
        ' <<<"$group_json")
    fi

    # deep wins over light if any member is deep
    max_lane=$(jq -r '
      if any(.[].validation_lane; . == "deep") then "deep" else "light" end
    ' <<<"$group_json")

    # most actionable: auto_fixable > manual > report_only
    max_act=$(jq -r '
      [.[].actionability]
      | sort_by({"report_only":1, "manual":2, "auto_fixable":3}[.]) | last
    ' <<<"$group_json")
    ```

4. Apply to the keeper in one patch:

    ```bash
    artifact-patch.py \
      --path "$artifact_path" --finding-id K \
      --set-json "sources=$union_sources" \
      --set-json "source_families=$union_families" \
      --set "origin_confidence=$max_conf" \
      --set "validation_lane=$max_lane" \
      --set "actionability=$max_act"
    ```

5. Delete each dupe. Pipe the group's dupe ids (everything past the
   keeper) through `xargs -n 1` — no shell `for ... in $var` loops; bash
   3.2 + macOS zsh word-splitting footguns make that pattern unreliable
   for multi-dupe groups:

    ```bash
    jq -r '.[1:][]' <<<'["K","D1","D2"]' \
      | xargs -n 1 -I '{}' \
          artifact-patch.py --path "$artifact_path" --delete-finding '{}'
    ```

    (Substitute the actual group-id array for `["K","D1","D2"]`.)

### 2.4. Log Phase 2 summary

```bash
phase_2_elapsed=$(( $(date +%s) - phase_2_start_epoch ))
post_count=$(artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" --filter '.findings | length')

# candidates before - candidates after = merged
merged=$(( pre_dedup_count - post_count ))

log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 2 --name dedup \
  --elapsed "$phase_2_elapsed" \
  --summary "groups=<N>; merged=$merged; surviving=$post_count"

log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 2 --record "$(jq -nc \
    --argjson elapsed "$phase_2_elapsed" \
    --argjson survivors "$post_count" \
    --argjson merged "$merged" \
    '{name:"dedup", elapsed_sec:$elapsed, counts_by_state:{open:$survivors}, counts_by_disposition:{pending_validation:$survivors}, delta:"-\($merged) merged"}')"
```

Capture `phase_2_start_epoch` and `pre_dedup_count` at the top of Phase 2
(the latter via `artifact-read.sh --filter '.findings | length'`).
