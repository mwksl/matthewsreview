## Phase 1.5 — Ensemble adapter (conditional on `--ensemble`)

**Skip this entire phase** unless `ensemble_mode == true` (captured in Phase 0
step 0.1). Log one line to `trace.md` and proceed to Phase 2:

```
Phase 1.5 skipped — --ensemble not set
```

**Dispatch under §13.12.** When `--ensemble` IS set, Phase 1.5's CLI
launches and PR scrape fire in the same orchestrator turn as the
Phase 1 lens `Agent` dispatches — see 01-detection.md step 1.3. This
fragment documents the Phase-1.5-owned work (readiness pointer,
launch specs, normalizer, token logging, summary); execution sequencing
is orchestrated from 01-detection.md. The readiness gate moved to
01-detection.md step 1.2a so missing-CLI prompts surface before any
token spend.

Phase 1.5 pulls additional candidates from three external channels:

1. **CodeRabbit CLI** — `coderabbit review --agent -t all --base <base>`, a
   local Claude-like review that emits findings to stdout (does not post to
   the PR). Runs in background; result awaited before the normalizer dispatch.
2. **Codex CLI** — `node "$CODEX_COMPANION" task --prompt-file <file>`, a
   local Codex-based review. Same shape.
3. **GitHub PR comment scrape** — `external-scrape.sh` pulls bot-authored
   comments posted to the PR since `review_started_at`. Only runs when
   `mode == pr`. Local mode can't scrape a PR that doesn't exist.

All three feed a single Sonnet normalizer sub-agent that emits
standard candidates. The normalizer's output pools into the
orchestrator-context `external_candidates` variable; the join step at
01-detection.md 1.5 assigns ids and commits to `artifact.findings[]`
with `source_family: "external-deep-family"` and
`origin_confidence: "low"`.

**Token accounting.** The CodeRabbit and Codex CLIs are EXTERNAL processes —
their token spend is billed separately by their respective providers and is
NOT logged to `tokens.jsonl` (clarification vs DESIGN §11's "wrapper
orchestration tokens tracked" language — with CLI dispatch there is no
Claude wrapper sub-agent to track). Only the Sonnet normalizer is logged,
under `phase_1_5`.

### 1.5.1. Readiness — already done in the Phase 1 fragment (§13.12)

Under §13.12, the readiness check, scratch-dir creation, and Codex
prompt file write all live in `01-detection.md` step 1.2a — they run
BEFORE any dispatch so missing-CLI prompts surface ahead of token
spend. `phase_1_5_start_epoch` is captured at the tail of step 1.2b
(§13.11b) — after the prior-fix suspect scan — so neither the
readiness-gate user wait nor the helper runtime is billed into Phase
1.5's elapsed.

By the time execution reaches this fragment, the following are already
in your working context:

- `coderabbit_available` (bool) and, if false, `coderabbit_reason`
- `codex_available` (bool) and, if false, `codex_reason`
- `CODEX_COMPANION` (path, if Codex available)
- `scratch_dir` (`/tmp/adams-review-$review_id`)
- `phase_1_5_start_epoch` (captured at end of 1.2b, not at this fragment)
- Codex prompt file at `/tmp/adams-review-codex-$review_id.md` (if
  Codex available)

If `ensemble_mode != true`, this entire fragment is skipped — trace.md
gets one line:

```
Phase 1.5 skipped — --ensemble not set
```

…and execution proceeds to Phase 2. Under `ensemble_mode=true`,
continue with step 1.5.2.

### 1.5.2. Launch CLI reviewers (background Bash; dispatched from 01 step 1.3)

These launches are tool-use blocks in the **01-detection.md step 1.3
dispatch turn** — alongside the lens `Agent` blocks (§13.12). Under
`--ensemble` the lens count is 7 (L1–L7 including the ensemble-gated
holistic lens); non-ensemble runs never reach this fragment. This
section is the authoritative spec for the commands themselves; refer
back from step 1.3 to find the command strings.

For each available CLI reviewer, launch in background and capture the
shell id. The diff used is `$comparison_ref..HEAD` (§13.10 — the
freshness-reconciled ref, not the literal `$base_branch` name, so
ensemble reviewers see the same diff surface as the internal lenses
under option (b) `used_remote_ref`).

**CodeRabbit:**

```bash
coderabbit review --agent -t all --base "$comparison_ref" \
  > "$scratch_dir/coderabbit.out" 2> "$scratch_dir/coderabbit.err"
```

(If CodeRabbit rejects a remote-ref `--base` like `origin/main`, fall
back to `base_branch` and record the degradation in `trace.md`. In
practice CodeRabbit accepts any revspec git understands.)

Launch with the Bash tool using `run_in_background: true`. Capture the
returned shell id as `coderabbit_shell_id`. If `coderabbit_available ==
false`, skip this launch.

**Codex:**

The prompt file was already written in 01-detection.md step 1.2a (the
readiness gate). Just invoke the CLI:

```bash
node "$CODEX_COMPANION" task --prompt-file "/tmp/adams-review-codex-$review_id.md" \
  > "$scratch_dir/codex.out" 2> "$scratch_dir/codex.err"
```

Launch with `run_in_background: true`; capture shell id as
`codex_shell_id`. If `codex_available == false`, skip.

### 1.5.3. PR comment scrape (PR mode only; dispatched from 01 step 1.3)

While the CLI reviewers are running, synchronously scrape bot comments
and run the §13.13 code-locality filter. The scrape (`external-scrape.sh`
§21.8) fetches every bot-authored comment on the PR; the freshness
filter (`comment-freshness.sh` §21.10) drops records whose referenced
code has changed between when the comment was posted and HEAD. Guard
the exit-code captures with `||` so `set -e` orchestrator context
doesn't abort on non-zero — we deliberately want to read the code and
continue per §24.2:

```bash
if [[ "$mode" == "pr" ]]; then
    external-scrape.sh \
        --pr "$pr_number" \
        > "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.raw.json" \
        2> "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.err" \
        || scrape_exit=$?
    scrape_exit=${scrape_exit:-0}

    if [[ $scrape_exit -eq 0 ]]; then
        reviewed_files_csv=$(printf '%s\n' "$reviewed_files_all" \
            | awk 'NF' | paste -sd, -)

        # Pipe through comment-freshness.sh. Audit lines (`comment_freshness: …`)
        # flow into trace.md via `tee -a` — mirrors origin-crosscheck.sh
        # dispatch at 01-detection.md step 1.4 step 2a.
        if ! comment-freshness.sh \
                --pr "$pr_number" \
                --reviewed-files "$reviewed_files_csv" \
                --comments "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.raw.json" \
                > "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.json" \
                2> >(tee -a "$trace_log_path" >&2); then
            # Freshness helper itself failed (rare — its own errors log to
            # stderr with a `comment_freshness_api_failed` prefix). Degrade
            # gracefully: use the raw scrape. Log the tag so a reader can
            # explain why stale-but-pre-existing comments made it through.
            printf 'phase_1_5_freshness_helper_failed: using raw scrape\n' \
                >> "$trace_log_path"
            cp "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.raw.json" "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.json"
        fi
    else
        # Scrape failed — write an empty array so downstream consumers
        # don't trip on a missing file. The scrape-failed tag is logged
        # below per §24.2.
        echo "[]" > "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.json"
    fi
else
    echo "[]" > "$scratch_dir/pr-scrape.json"
    scrape_exit=0
fi
```

On scrape non-zero exit (rate limit, auth, network) per §24.2: log
stderr to `trace.md` with tag `phase_1_5_scrape_failed`; continue with
the CLI reviewer outputs only. Do not abort. The freshness-filter
failure path (inner `if`) is separately logged because it can fire
independently of the scrape succeeding.

### 1.5.4. Collect CLI reviewer outputs

Poll each background shell via the `BashOutput` tool — it's the only
non-blocking read-current-output mechanism granted in
`review.md`'s `allowed-tools` block. Do not wait serially — check
both concurrently so one slow reviewer doesn't hold up the other.

Apply a reasonable timeout (e.g., 10 minutes — ensemble reviewers can be
slow on large diffs). On timeout, capture whatever output exists, mark the
reviewer as `timed_out`, and continue.

Capture these variables per reviewer as the background shell resolves —
the status computation below reads each one by name, so every branch
must set every variable:

- `coderabbit_exit_code` — integer exit code from the background shell
  (`BashOutput` exposes it when the shell exits); default `0` for the
  skipped branch.
- `coderabbit_timed_out` — `"true"` if the 10-minute deadline elapsed
  before the shell exited, else `"false"`.
- (Same two variables for Codex: `codex_exit_code`, `codex_timed_out`.)

After each reviewer resolves, set the status variable that the Phase-1.5
summary record at step 1.5.7 will reference:

```bash
# After CodeRabbit resolves (success / failure / timeout):
if [[ "$coderabbit_available" == "false" ]]; then
    coderabbit_status=skipped
elif [[ "${coderabbit_timed_out:-false}" == "true" ]]; then
    coderabbit_status=timed_out
elif [[ "${coderabbit_exit_code:-0}" -ne 0 ]] || [[ ! -s "$scratch_dir/coderabbit.out" ]]; then
    coderabbit_status=failed
else
    coderabbit_status=success
fi

# (Same shape for codex_status with $codex_* variables.)
```

On failed / timed_out, log to `trace.md` with tag
`phase_1_5_coderabbit_failed` (or `_codex_failed`); drop that source
from the normalizer input. On success, pass stdout to the normalizer.

Clean up the Codex prompt file:

```bash
rm -f "/tmp/adams-review-codex-$review_id.md"
```

### 1.5.5. Normalize all external inputs (single Sonnet sub-agent)

Pass the normalizer all three inputs in its prompt. The sub-agent produces
one unified candidate list. This follows §19.2a verbatim.

Dispatch via `Agent` with `model: sonnet`. Prompt essence:

> You are normalizing external-reviewer output into the adamsreview
> candidate schema. You receive three inputs:
>
> **1. PR bot comments** (JSON array; may be empty):
>
> ```
> <contents of $scratch_dir/pr-scrape.json>
> ```
>
> Each entry has `{id, author_login, author_type, created_at, body, kind,
> path?, line?, commit_id?}`.
>
> **2. CodeRabbit stdout** (free-form Markdown text; may be empty):
>
> ```
> <contents of $scratch_dir/coderabbit.out>
> ```
>
> **3. Codex stdout** (free-form Markdown/JSON; may be empty):
>
> ```
> <contents of $scratch_dir/codex.out>
> ```
>
> Extract concrete issues from each. If a single comment or message covers
> multiple distinct issues, emit one candidate per issue. Infer `file` and
> `line_range` from explicit `path`/`line` fields when present, else from
> the body text (e.g. "In `src/foo.ts:45`..."). If neither is available,
> emit the candidate with `file: null` — Phase 2 dedup may still match it
> against internal findings.
>
> Classify `impact_type` conservatively: prefer `correctness` when unclear;
> never reach for `security` without concrete evidence.
>
> Discard comments that are questions, praise, or general commentary — only
> normalize content that identifies an issue in the diff.
>
> Return a JSON array. Each candidate:
>
> ```
> {
>   "file": "src/path/to/file.ts" | null,
>   "line_range": [start, end] | null,
>   "claim": "one-sentence description",
>   "evidence_snippet": "the implicated code or the original comment body",
>   "impact_type": "correctness" | "security" | "ux" | "policy" | "architecture",
>   "origin": "introduced_by_pr" | "pre_existing" | "unknown",
>   "origin_confidence": "low",
>   "source_family": "external-deep-family",
>   "sources": ["external-pr:<author_login>" | "codex" | "coderabbit"]
> }
> ```
>
> `origin_confidence` is ALWAYS `"low"` for external candidates —
> internal corroboration in Phase 4 decides whether they surface.

**After the normalizer returns**, repair missing location info and
emit the result to `external_candidates` for the join step at
01-detection.md step 1.5. Do NOT call `--add-finding` here (§13.12 —
ids are assigned atomically at the join, not per-phase).

**Schema guard for missing location info.** The normalizer prompt
allows `file: null` / `line_range: null` for candidates whose body
text didn't specify a location. Schema (`schema-v1.json`) requires
`file` non-null with `minLength:1` and `line_range` as `[int,int]`
with both items `>=1`. Repair before pooling — default to a sentinel
so the finding is still stored (Phase 2 dedup + Phase 4 validation may
still match it against an internal finding with proper location):

```bash
external_candidates=$(echo "$normalizer_output" | jq -c '
  [ .[] | . + {
      file:       (.file // "(unknown)"),
      line_range: (.line_range // [1,1])
    } ]
')
```

Leave a one-line `trace.md` note per repaired candidate so the user
knows where the ambiguity came from (iterate with `jq -r` to produce
the notes before the merge).

### 1.5.6. Log normalizer tokens

Log the normalizer's tokens under `phase_1_5`:

```bash
log-tokens.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase phase_1_5 \
  --agent-role external_normalizer --agent-id <id> \
  --model sonnet --tokens <N or null>
```

(The `--add-finding` sweep moved to 01-detection.md step 1.5 per
§13.12 — it runs once across the combined internal + external pool
after ids are assigned. Do not `--add-finding` here.)

### 1.5.6b. Clean up scratch_dir

```bash
rm -rf -- "$scratch_dir"
```

Keep `$review_dir` free of transient CLI output (§9.3). Any
orchestrator-fatal failure before this point leaves the scratch dir
for post-mortem inspection.

### 1.5.7. Log Phase 1.5 summary

```bash
phase_1_5_elapsed=$(( $(date +%s) - phase_1_5_start_epoch ))

log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 1_5 --name ensemble-adapter \
  --elapsed "$phase_1_5_elapsed" \
  --summary "coderabbit=$coderabbit_status; codex=$codex_status; scrape_bots=$scrape_bot_count; normalized=$external_candidate_count"

log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 1_5 --record "$(jq -nc \
    --arg name ensemble-adapter \
    --argjson elapsed "$phase_1_5_elapsed" \
    --argjson added "$external_candidate_count" \
    '{name:$name, elapsed_sec:$elapsed, counts_by_state:{open:$added}, counts_by_disposition:{pending_validation:$added}, delta:"+\($added) external"}')"
```

Where `coderabbit_status` is one of `success|failed|skipped|timed_out`
(same for `codex_status`).

### Working-set delta after Phase 1.5

- `external_candidates` (orchestrator-context pool) holds the
  normalized + location-repaired candidates. The join step at
  01-detection.md 1.5 consumes it; `artifact.findings[]` does NOT grow
  until then.
- `tokens.jsonl` grew one entry for the normalizer (not for the CLI
  reviewers — those are external processes).
- `phases.jsonl` grew a Phase 1.5 record (ts overlaps Phase 1's under
  §13.12 joint dispatch).
- `trace.md` grew a Phase 1.5 section.
