## Phase 1 — Detection

Six internal lenses run in parallel to produce candidate findings; a
seventh (L7 holistic) joins the fan-out when `--ensemble` is set. Each
lens returns a list of candidates tagged with routing fields
(`impact_type`, `origin`, `origin_confidence`, `source_family`). The
orchestrator merges all lens outputs into `artifact.findings[]` via a
single batched `artifact-patch.py --add-findings` call (see §1.5
step 4).

**Dispatch parallelism.** To get actual wall-clock parallelism across lenses,
send every applicable lens's `Agent` tool-use block inside a single
orchestrator turn. Claude Code then runs them concurrently. Collecting the
results happens on the next turn.

### 1.1. Decide which lenses run

Based on the Phase 0 variables:

| Lens | Model | Runs when |
|---|---|---|
| L1 — diff-local scan | `sonnet` | always |
| L2 — structural / blast-radius | `opus` | `trivial_mode != true` |
| L3 — CLAUDE.md compliance | `sonnet` | always |
| L4 — comment compliance | `sonnet` | always |
| L5 — UX | `sonnet` | `user_facing == true AND trivial_mode != true` |
| L6 — lightweight security | `sonnet` | `trivial_mode != true` |
| L7 — holistic review | `opus` | `ensemble_mode == true AND trivial_mode != true` |

Skipped lenses get a one-line note in `trace.md`:
```
Phase 1: L7 skipped (ensemble_mode=false)
Phase 1: L2/L5/L6/L7 skipped (trivial_mode=true)
```

Log them via `log-phase.sh --summary` at step 1.6 as part of the Phase 1
summary.

### 1.2. Build the shared input

Compute the diff once against `$comparison_ref` (not `$base_branch`; see
Phase 0 step 0.2a / §13.10 — when the user chose "compare against
`origin/$base_branch`", `comparison_ref` points at the remote ref while
`base_branch` stays the human name):

```bash
git diff "$comparison_ref..HEAD"
```

All lenses see this full diff. L1, L3, L4, L5, L6 operate primarily on the
diff; L2 (and L7 under `--ensemble`) additionally read surrounding files
and use git blame / git log.

For lenses that receive CLAUDE.md content (L3, L4, L5, L6), pass
`claude_md_paths` (the list captured in Phase 0, step 0.7). Each lens
reads only what it needs.

### 1.2.1. Shared lens-prompt invariants

Every lens dispatched in step 1.3 must receive the following invariants
in its prompt (exact wording — the sub-agents need them verbatim so
candidate shapes don't diverge across lenses). Each lens's sub-section
below restates **only lens-specific guidance**; the orchestrator
prepends this shared block when assembling the dispatch prompt.

The orchestrator dispatches `<shared invariants> + <lens body>` as the
sub-agent prompt. The shared invariants and the lens body both live in
files now (extracted per `plans/codex-review.md` §4.1 so
`/matthewsreview:codex-review` can consume the same source).

Shared invariants: Read `fragments/lens-prompts/_shared-invariants.md`
— its content is the shared block prepended to every lens's prompt
body. Prose outside the file (headings, annotations, commentary) is
for the fragment reader, **NOT dispatched** — any directive the
sub-agent must follow has to live inside the file.

**Substitute orchestrator-context placeholders before dispatch.** The
file content carries literal `$comparison_ref` (the diff range — set
in Phase 0 step 0.2a) and `$reviewed_sha` (the reviewed file SHA — set
in Phase 0 step 0.10) tokens that must resolve to their working-context
values BEFORE the prompt reaches the sub-agent. (Pre-Round-1 the
invariants were inlined here; the orchestrator's implicit
working-context-variable substitution covered them. Post-extraction
the file content is opaque, so the substitution must be explicit, the
same way `fragments/01-codex-detection.md` §1.2c handles it.)

```bash
shared_invariants_body="${shared_invariants_body//\$comparison_ref/$comparison_ref}"
shared_invariants_body="${shared_invariants_body//\$reviewed_sha/$reviewed_sha}"
```

The lens-body files (`fragments/lens-prompts/L<N>.md`) are read in
step 1.3's bulk pre-read (one parallel batch of `Read` tool-uses
before the dispatch turn). L2's body carries `$prior_fix_suspects`,
L3's and L5's bodies carry `$claude_md_paths` — substitute these the
same way before the dispatch turn (the lens dispatch sub-sections
below specify the per-lens substitutions).

Lens-specific extensions the shared block does **not** cover (keep
inline in each lens sub-section):

- "ONLY the diff" vs. "diff plus surrounding files / git blame / git
  log" — lens-specific reading scope (L1 is diff-only; L2 and L7 walk
  outward).
- CLAUDE.md reading — L3, L4, L5 consume `$claude_md_paths`; others
  don't.
- "Over-flag; Phase 3 will filter" directive — appears in L1, L2, L6,
  L7 where over-flag is the intended posture; L3/L4/L5 don't carry it.
- Lens-specific failure modes, checklist items, impact-type tags, and
  source-family tags.

Origin defaults (the `introduced_by_pr` / `pre_existing` rule) live in
the shared block above and apply to every lens uniformly. After
dispatch, `origin-crosscheck.sh` (step 1.4 step 2a) blame-traces each
candidate. Its main path trusts the lens's origin call (downgrades
`pre_existing/high` to medium when blame disagrees, and sets
`pre_existing/medium` for any non-`pre_existing/high` lens output
whose blame is fully ancestor — covering both wrong-line-range cites
and exposure findings). Its rename-follow path is the one place blame trumps the
lens, overriding to `pre_existing/high` for content-preserving file
extractions where `git log --follow` reaches a pre-PR ancestor (F038
case) — there the extraction trace is stronger evidence than the
lens claim.

### 1.2a. Ensemble readiness gate (§13.12)

This gate runs before the dispatch turn so a missing-CLI prompt surfaces
ahead of any token spend. Under `ensemble_mode=false` it's a one-line
no-op; under `ensemble_mode=true` it probes Codex, may prompt the user
via `AskUserQuestion`, and prepares the scratch directory + Codex
prompt file for the joint dispatch at step 1.3.

**When `ensemble_mode != true`:**

Skip the gate. Record one line in `trace.md`:

```
Phase 1 ensemble readiness gate skipped — --ensemble not set
```

Set `codex_available=false` in your working context (so downstream
fragments can short-circuit uniformly) and continue to step 1.3.

**When `ensemble_mode == true`:**

Create the scratch directory for CLI output (keeps `$review_dir`
free of transient noise):

```bash
scratch_dir="/tmp/matthews-review-$review_id"
mkdir -p "$scratch_dir"
```

Check Codex availability:

```bash
CODEX_COMPANION="$(find ~/.claude/plugins -type f -name codex-companion.mjs -path '*codex*' 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
if [[ -z "$CODEX_COMPANION" ]]; then
    codex_available=false
    codex_reason="companion script not found — run /codex:setup"
else
    # Companion CLI surface: `setup --json` emits {"ready": true|false, ...}.
    # The older `ready` subcommand does not exist — parse the JSON's
    # `.ready` boolean instead of grep-matching a literal string.
    codex_setup_json=$(node "$CODEX_COMPANION" setup --json 2>&1)
    codex_ready=$(jq -r '.ready // false' <<<"$codex_setup_json" 2>/dev/null)
    if [[ "$codex_ready" == "true" ]]; then
        codex_available=true
    else
        # Cold-start false-negative bypass (shared session mode):
        # `.ready` rolls up `.auth.loggedIn`, which is verified through
        # the broker socket. The broker only materializes once a task
        # is running, so a fresh probe sees ENOENT on
        # /tmp/cxc-*/broker.sock and reports not-ready even though
        # `.codex.available` (CLI binary present) is true. Treat that
        # exact shape as ready; the first lens dispatch warms the
        # broker. (`.auth.available` is intentionally NOT checked — the
        # companion's auth-status builder hardcodes it true regardless
        # of credential state, so it's cargo-cult; `.auth.loggedIn` is
        # the real auth signal and is what the broker round-trip
        # gates.)
        #
        # Edge case: if the user has logged out but a stale saved
        # broker-session file remains, the probe is structurally
        # indistinguishable from a legitimate cold start (same ENOENT
        # path), so this bypass also fires. The first lens dispatch
        # then surfaces the auth failure with an actionable error.
        # Acceptable trade-off; the alternative (active warm-up +
        # re-probe) costs a Codex turn on every cold start.
        #
        # Any other not-ready shape (missing CLI, direct-mode failure,
        # malformed payload) falls through to the AskUserQuestion
        # prompt below.
        cx_mode=$(jq -r '.sessionRuntime.mode // ""' <<<"$codex_setup_json" 2>/dev/null)
        cx_cli=$(jq -r '.codex.available // false' <<<"$codex_setup_json" 2>/dev/null)
        cx_auth_detail=$(jq -r '.auth.detail // ""' <<<"$codex_setup_json" 2>/dev/null)
        if [[ "$cx_mode" == "shared" && "$cx_cli" == "true" \
              && "$cx_auth_detail" == *"ENOENT"*"broker.sock"* ]]; then
            codex_available=true
            printf '%s\n' "Phase 1 readiness: shared-mode cold-start broker ENOENT — bypassed (first lens warms the broker)" \
                >> "$review_dir/trace.md"
        else
            codex_available=false
            codex_reason="setup --json reported not-ready — run /codex:setup to diagnose"
        fi
    fi
fi
```

**If Codex is available**, proceed silently. **If Codex is
unavailable**, dispatch `AskUserQuestion` **once** with two options:

- **Proceed without Codex** — in PR mode, continue with the PR
  bot-comment scrape only; in local mode, this leaves Phase 1.5 with
  no external sources (skipped). Either way, `codex=skipped` lands in
  the Phase 1.5 narrative summary in `trace.md` (via §1.5.7's
  `log-phase.sh --summary`); the final report's `reviewer_sources`
  reflects the absence.
- **Stop so I can set it up first** — exit the command. Print the
  exact remediation command (`/codex:setup`) and let the user fix
  first.

Stopping here costs zero lens tokens — the whole point of hoisting the
gate ahead of dispatch.

**If `codex_available=true`**, also write the Codex prompt file here so
the dispatch turn at 1.3 is pure launches with no side effects:

```bash
cat > "/tmp/matthews-review-codex-$review_id.md" <<PROMPT
Review this PR as a skeptical careful reader — the kind of reviewer who
catches bugs a linter and the test suite miss. Range: the diff between
$comparison_ref and HEAD, plus surrounding code you need to understand it.

For every function the diff adds or modifies, look for:
- Inputs the function silently accepts that it shouldn't (prefix parsers
  like parseFloat/parseInt accepting trailing junk; regex gates that
  check digit shape but not range; validators that trust their input
  where a sibling in the same file is deliberately strict).
- Failure paths that produce misleading errors — especially try/catch
  blocks that wrap a state-changing operation (DB commit, file rename,
  UPSERT, network publish) together with post-commit work, so a
  post-commit throw surfaces as "operation failed" and users retry,
  double-applying.
- Termination / completion invariants that aren't checked — hand-rolled
  parsers (state machines, tokenizers, CSV/JSON/form readers) that
  don't verify they ended in a completed state at EOF.
- Parallel paths whose strictness has diverged — sibling parsers or
  validators in the same file where one is strict and one isn't; two
  filter predicates that should apply the same rule and don't; a SQL
  JOIN that fans out because the source table has multiple rows per
  join key.
- Filter predicates / COALESCE / NULLIF chains that miss a value some
  upstream writer legitimately produces (negative numbers, zero, NULL,
  duplicate-by-type rows) — trace every writer of the column, not just
  the happy-path writer.
- Project-convention violations visible in nearby CLAUDE.md rules or
  adjacent code style.

Return findings as a structured list — each with file path, line range,
and concrete prose describing the bug and why it matters. Over-report;
downstream filtering picks up the rest.
PROMPT
```

`phase_1_5_start_epoch` is captured at the END of step 1.2b (after the
deterministic prior-fix scan completes) — see the tail of 1.2b below.
That placement keeps both Phase 1 and Phase 1.5 clocks aligned with
the step 1.3 dispatch-turn boundary, so neither phase's `elapsed_sec`
over-reports Phase 0-style work done beforehand.

### 1.2b. Prior-fix suspect scan (§13.11b)

Before dispatching lenses, scan git history for prior "fix" commits
whose changes overlap the PR's diff. The output feeds L2's prompt so
L2 can judge whether the current change undoes any suspect fix — the
deterministic half of prior-fix-reversion detection; L2 is the judge.

Skipped when `$trivial_mode` is true (L2 is skipped too, so the
suspects have no consumer):

```bash
if [[ "$trivial_mode" != "true" ]]; then
    reviewed_files_csv=$(printf '%s\n' "$reviewed_files_all" \
      | awk 'NF' | paste -sd, -)

    prior_fix_suspects=$(
        prior-fix-diff.sh \
          --comparison-ref "$comparison_ref" \
          --reviewed-files "$reviewed_files_csv" \
          2> >(tee -a "$trace_log_path" >&2)
    ) || prior_fix_suspects="[]"
else
    prior_fix_suspects="[]"
fi
```

On helper non-zero exit, fall back to `[]` — L2's prior-fix section
becomes a no-op, which is the right degraded behavior (the rest of
L2's prompt still runs normally). Per-file audit lines
(`prior_fix_diff: file=... hunks=... suspects=...`) flow into
`trace.md` via the `tee -a` pattern — mirrors `origin-crosscheck.sh`
dispatch at step 1.4 step 2a.

`$prior_fix_suspects` is held in orchestrator working context and
consumed once at step 1.3 (L2's prompt). No artifact write here —
suspects are prompt input, not findings.

**Finally, capture `phase_1_5_start_epoch`** — AFTER the readiness-gate
`AskUserQuestion` (from step 1.2a) may have run AND after the prior-fix
helper completes, so neither user-response wait time nor helper runtime
is billed into Phase 1.5's elapsed:

```bash
phase_1_5_start_epoch=$(date +%s)
```

This epoch is what 02-ensemble-adapter.md step 1.5.7 subtracts to
compute `phase_1_5_elapsed`. Placing it here mirrors Phase 1's
`phase_1_start_epoch` capture in step 1.3's pre-dispatch init —
Phase 1.5 starts after readiness/prior-fix work and Phase 1 starts
just before the lens fan-out, so both clocks bracket the §13.12
dispatch turn and the two `elapsed_sec` values naturally overlap in
`phases.jsonl`.

### 1.3. Dispatch the lenses (one turn, one Agent call per applicable lens)

**Parallel dispatch — load-bearing.** Read all applicable
`fragments/lens-prompts/L<N>.md` files plus
`fragments/lens-prompts/_shared-invariants.md` first (these `Read`
tool-uses can run in parallel within one orchestrator turn). Then
issue EVERY applicable lens's `Agent` tool-use in a SINGLE
orchestrator turn so they run concurrently — alongside the ensemble
fan-out's background `Bash` call when `ensemble_mode == true` (see
the "Ensemble fan-out" sub-section below). The per-lens sub-sections
that follow are declarative spec data — the dispatch model, prompt
body location, and substitution rules (`$prior_fix_suspects`,
`$claude_md_paths`) for each lens; they are reference material, NOT
seven serial action targets. The unambiguous action target is the
"#### Dispatch turn" sub-section after L7. Treating each per-lens
sub-section as its own dispatch turn defeats the parallelism this
phase relies on: Phase 1 wall-clock latency goes from
`max(lens_durations)` to `sum(lens_durations)`, and the ensemble
fan-out's background CLI loses its overlap window with the lens
dispatches.

#### L1 — diff-local scan (Sonnet)

> **Read L1–L7 before issuing any Agent tool-use.** The per-lens sub-sections
> below are spec data (model, prompt body, substitutions). Issue every
> applicable lens's `Agent` block in the single `#### Dispatch turn` at the
> end of this section — one orchestrator turn, not seven. Phase 1 latency is
> `max(lens_durations)`, not `sum(lens_durations)`.

Dispatch spec: `model: sonnet`, `subagent_type: general-purpose`.

Prompt body: `fragments/lens-prompts/L1.md` (read in step 1.3's bulk
pre-read; its content is the L1 prompt body verbatim). Final prompt =
shared invariants (from step 1.2.1) + lens body.

#### L2 — structural / blast-radius (Opus; skipped if `trivial_mode`)

> **Spec data — issue this lens's `Agent` block in the single `#### Dispatch turn` at the end of §1.3, not here.**

Dispatch spec: `model: opus`, `subagent_type: general-purpose`. The
sub-agent inherits the parent command's `Read` + `Bash(git:*)` +
`Bash(grep:*)` grants (this already covers it).

L2 additionally reads surrounding files and uses `git blame` / `git log`.

Prompt body: `fragments/lens-prompts/L2.md` (read in step 1.3's bulk
pre-read; its content is the L2 prompt body verbatim). Per-lens
substitution: `$prior_fix_suspects` → the JSON array captured at step
1.2b. Final prompt = shared invariants (from step 1.2.1) + lens body
(with substitution applied).

#### L3 — CLAUDE.md compliance (Sonnet)

> **Spec data — issue this lens's `Agent` block in the single `#### Dispatch turn` at the end of §1.3, not here.**

Dispatch spec: `model: sonnet`.

Prompt body: `fragments/lens-prompts/L3.md` (read in step 1.3's bulk
pre-read; its content is the L3 prompt body verbatim). Per-lens
substitution: `$claude_md_paths` → the newline-joined list from Phase
0 step 0.7. Final prompt = shared invariants (from step 1.2.1) + lens
body (with substitution applied).

#### L4 — comment compliance (Sonnet)

> **Spec data — issue this lens's `Agent` block in the single `#### Dispatch turn` at the end of §1.3, not here.**

Dispatch spec: `model: sonnet`.

L4 additionally reads the current content of every modified file.

Prompt body: `fragments/lens-prompts/L4.md` (read in step 1.3's bulk
pre-read; its content is the L4 prompt body verbatim). Final prompt =
shared invariants (from step 1.2.1) + lens body.

#### L5 — UX (Sonnet; skipped if `trivial_mode` or `user_facing == false`)

> **Spec data — issue this lens's `Agent` block in the single `#### Dispatch turn` at the end of §1.3, not here.**

Dispatch spec: `model: sonnet`.

Prompt body: `fragments/lens-prompts/L5.md` (read in step 1.3's bulk
pre-read; its content is the L5 prompt body verbatim — the canonical
content; `fragments/lens-ux-reference.md` is a redundant duplicate kept
for now to avoid scope creep). Per-lens substitution: `$claude_md_paths`
→ the newline-joined list from Phase 0 step 0.7. Final prompt = shared
invariants (from step 1.2.1) + lens body (with substitution applied).

#### L6 — lightweight security (Sonnet; skipped if `trivial_mode`)

> **Spec data — issue this lens's `Agent` block in the single `#### Dispatch turn` at the end of §1.3, not here.**

Dispatch spec: `model: sonnet`.

Prompt body: `fragments/lens-prompts/L6.md` (read in step 1.3's bulk
pre-read; its content is the L6 prompt body verbatim — the canonical
content; `fragments/lens-security-reference.md` is a redundant
duplicate kept for now to avoid scope creep). Final prompt = shared
invariants (from step 1.2.1) + lens body.

#### L7 — holistic review (Opus; `ensemble_mode` only; skipped if `trivial_mode`)

> **Spec data — issue this lens's `Agent` block in the single `#### Dispatch turn` at the end of §1.3, not here.**

Dispatch spec: `model: opus`, `subagent_type: general-purpose`.
Inherits the parent command's Read + Bash(git:*) + Bash(grep:*) grants —
same permissions as L2.

L7 exists as a recall-oriented safety net: focused lenses have narrower
prompts tuned to specific bug classes; L7 reads the diff like a skeptical
senior reviewer with no checklist. Ensemble-gated because it costs roughly
1.5–2x an L2 pass. Phase 2 dedup merges overlaps with focused-lens
findings (unioning `source_families`) so duplicates become a strengthening
signal via Phase 3's ≥2-families auto-graduate rule, not noise.

L7 additionally reads surrounding code and uses `git blame` / `git log`
freely.

Prompt body: `fragments/lens-prompts/L7.md` (read in step 1.3's bulk
pre-read; its content is the L7 prompt body verbatim). Final prompt =
shared invariants (from step 1.2.1) + lens body.

#### Dispatch turn (one turn, all blocks)

**Pre-dispatch init** (orchestrator working context — not a separate
tool-use turn): capture the phase epoch and seed the in-context
candidate pool that §1.4 will append to as lens results return.

```bash
phase_1_start_epoch=$(date +%s)
internal_candidates='[]'
```

These are working-context value initializations per CLAUDE.md
operational rule 11 ("Working set lives in-prompt, not shell vars"),
not `Bash` tool-uses; the orchestrator records them in-context
*before* issuing the `Agent` blocks below. The `phase_1_start_epoch`
capture mirrors the §1.2-Phase-1.5 `phase_1_5_start_epoch` so both
clocks bracket the §13.12 dispatch turn and the two `elapsed_sec`
values naturally overlap in `phases.jsonl`, and
`internal_candidates='[]'` is the seed value §1.4's per-lens
`--argjson accum "$internal_candidates"` appends require.

**Dispatch.** With every applicable lens's spec assembled (L1–L7
sub-sections above), issue every applicable lens's `Agent` tool-use
in a SINGLE orchestrator turn. The per-lens sub-sections are
reference data — a parameter sweep, not a turn sweep. Phase 1
wall-clock latency is `max(lens_durations)`, not `sum(lens_durations)`.

Under `ensemble_mode == true`, the Ensemble fan-out's background
`Bash` call (next sub-section) launches in this same turn — see the
"Total tool-use blocks" table below for the exact count by mode.

#### Ensemble fan-out (same turn, when `ensemble_mode == true`)

When `ensemble_mode=true`, the dispatch turn also launches the
external Codex CLI reviewer. It runs as a tool-use block in the same
orchestrator turn as the lens `Agent` dispatches above — waiting a
turn between them serializes what's meant to be parallel. The PR
comment scrape is NOT in this turn; it's deferred to §1.5.4 in
`02-ensemble-adapter.md` so third-party PR-comment bots have time
to land their posts during the CLI window.

Total tool-use blocks in the dispatch turn:

| Condition | Blocks |
|---|---|
| `ensemble_mode=false` | applicable lenses (6 max — L1..L6; L7 is ensemble-gated) |
| `ensemble_mode=true`, Codex available | lenses (up to 7, including L7) + 1 background Bash |
| `ensemble_mode=true`, Codex unavailable | lenses (up to 7) |

The ensemble launch spec lives in `02-ensemble-adapter.md`:

- **Codex** (background Bash) — see `02-ensemble-adapter.md` step
  1.5.2. Skip if `codex_available=false`. The prompt file was already
  written in step 1.2a; the launch block just invokes `node
  "$CODEX_COMPANION" task …`. Capture `codex_shell_id`.

Under `ensemble_mode=false`, this launch doesn't happen; the
02-ensemble-adapter fragment's top-level skip note fires when
execution reaches it and execution proceeds straight to Phase 2.

### 1.4. Collect lens candidates into pool

Collection runs per-lens as each sub-agent result returns — but under
§13.12 nothing gets an `id` and nothing is committed to the artifact
during collection. Candidates accumulate in an in-context pool
(`internal_candidates`, initialized in step 1.3's pre-dispatch init
along with `phase_1_start_epoch`) and are committed at the join step
1.5.

For each sub-agent result, in the order it returns:

1. **Log tokens first** (§24.4 — "cost accounted even for failed agents").
   Parse the sub-agent's `<usage>total_tokens: N</usage>` block. If the
   Agent tool result exposes a structured `usage` field directly, prefer
   that. On parse failure, use `--tokens null` per the §11 fallback.

   ```bash
   log-tokens.sh \
     --review-dir "$review_dir" \
     --phase phase_1 --agent-role <lens-name> \
     --agent-id <id-from-Agent-result> \
     --model <model> \
     --tokens <N or null>
   ```

   `<lens-name>` is one of `lens_1_diff_local`, `lens_2_structural`,
   `lens_3_claude_md`, `lens_4_comments`, `lens_5_ux`, `lens_6_security`,
   `lens_7_holistic`. The paired per-finding `sources[]` entry — used in
   the jq builder at step 1.5 — is the shorter lens tag: `L1-diff-local`,
   `L2-structural`, `L3-claude-md`, `L4-comments`, `L5-ux`, `L6-security`,
   `L7-holistic`.

2. **Light JSON repair** if the output isn't a parseable array — strip code
   fences, extract the JSON block. If still unparseable, retry once with
   prompt addendum: "Your prior response was not valid JSON. Return only
   the JSON array described in the schema." If still unparseable after the
   retry, append `lens_dropped_unparseable: lens=<lens-tag> attempts=2` to
   `$trace_log_path`, **SKIP step 2a entirely for this lens** (no
   origin-crosscheck call, no tagging, no pool append), and move on to the
   next lens. The lens contributes zero candidates this run — an unparseable
   lens is out of scope for blame classification, and origin-crosscheck was
   never the right recovery tool for it. Step 1.6's summary surfaces the
   drop count so a silent-fallthrough regression is visible.

2a. **Origin cross-check (§13.11).** Hand the lens's candidate array to
   `origin-crosscheck.sh` so blame-traceable cases get corrected before
   pool admission. **Main path** (file present in `$comparison_ref`):
   lens-supplied `pre_existing/high` confirmed by blame is respected;
   lens-supplied `pre_existing/high` whose blame includes PR commits is
   downgraded to medium (so §13.1 doesn't force-route to footnote);
   any lens output that is NOT `pre_existing/high` (introduced_by_pr at
   any confidence, `pre_existing/medium`, `pre_existing/low`, or
   unknown) whose blame is fully ancestor of `$comparison_ref` is set
   to `pre_existing/medium` with `action=downgraded` — Phase 3 + Phase
   4 then decide instead of force-routing wrong-line-range cites or
   exposure findings to the footnote (Option A2). The audit `reason`
   distinguishes the two main lens-input cases:
   `lens-introduced-by-pr-but-all-blame-ancestor` (when the lens said
   `introduced_by_pr`) vs. `lens-not-preexisting-high-but-all-blame-ancestor`
   (everything else). **Rename-follow path** is the lone case where
   blame trumps the lens: a content-preserving extraction whose
   `git log --follow` ancestor pre-dates the PR overrides to
   `pre_existing/high` (F038 case). See `CLAUDE.md`'s helper-index
   entry for the full decision table.

   ```bash
   # Defensive pre-check — step 2 should have already dropped unparseable
   # lens output, but belt-and-suspenders here converts any leaked-through
   # garbage into a loud skip audit line instead of a helper error plus
   # silent fallthrough into the tagging step.
   if ! echo "$lens_candidates_json" | jq -e 'type == "array"' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       printf 'origin_crosscheck_skipped: lens=%s reason=input_not_array\n' \
           "$lens_source_tag" >> "$trace_log_path"
       corrected_candidates="$lens_candidates_json"
   else
       corrected_candidates=$(
         origin-crosscheck.sh \
           --comparison-ref "$comparison_ref" \
           --candidates "$lens_candidates_json" \
           2> >(tee -a "$trace_log_path" >&2)
       )
   fi
   ```

   Stderr (one `origin_crosscheck: id=... action=...` line per
   candidate) flows directly into `trace.md` via the process
   substitution. On non-zero exit: the helper does NOT abort per-
   candidate blame failures (those surface as `action=skipped`), so a
   non-zero exit means something structural (unknown ref, bad JSON).
   Log the stderr to `trace.md` and fall through using
   `$lens_candidates_json` unchanged — respecting the lens across the
   board is the safe default when cross-check can't run. The
   `origin_crosscheck_skipped` audit line (different tag from the
   helper's own `origin_crosscheck:` per-candidate lines) is what step
   1.6 counts for the summary.

3. **Tag with `sources` and append to the pool.** Do NOT call
   `--add-finding` / `--add-findings` here; do NOT assign an id. The
   full-finding jq build moves to step 1.5 where ids are assigned
   atomically across the
   combined pool.

   Tag each corrected candidate with `sources: [<lens-tag>]` so the
   join step's helper (`assign-finding-ids.sh`) can sort by source
   priority. The lens-tag is the same short tag used in the token log
   above (`L1-diff-local`, `L2-structural`, etc.):

   ```bash
   tagged=$(echo "$corrected_candidates" \
     | jq --arg tag "$lens_source_tag" '[.[] | . + {sources: [$tag]}]')

   internal_candidates=$(jq -nc \
     --argjson accum "$internal_candidates" \
     --argjson new "$tagged" \
     '$accum + $new')
   ```

   The pool lives in your working context, not on disk — no intermediate
   artifact writes. If the orchestrator loses context mid-collection,
   Phase 1 has to re-run from dispatch.

   A common lens failure is `line_range: null` instead of `[N, N]`.
   Default to `[1, 1]` with a one-line `trace.md` note at collection
   time so the join step's jq builder doesn't blow up on a schema-
   invalid pool entry:

   ```bash
   tagged=$(echo "$tagged" \
     | jq '[.[] | .line_range //= [1,1]]')
   ```

### 1.5. Join + assign IDs + batched add-findings (§13.12)

Wait until every internal lens has returned AND (if `ensemble_mode ==
true`) `external_candidates` has been set — either by the no-input
early-skip at `02-ensemble-adapter.md` step 1.5.4b (sets `[]`) or by
the normalizer at step 1.5.5. Under `ensemble_mode=false`,
`external_candidates` defaults to `[]`.

**Step 1. Combine the two pools:**

```bash
pooled=$(jq -nc \
  --argjson internal "$internal_candidates" \
  --argjson external "${external_candidates:-[]}" \
  '$internal + $external')
```

**Step 2. Line-range sanity filter.** Lens agents (notably L5-ux) have
been observed fabricating `line_range` values well past the file's
actual length — Phase 4 validators then "confirm" because they
re-search the file for the claim pattern, and the rendered report
carries unreachable line numbers. Drop hallucinated-range candidates
before ids are assigned so wasted IDs don't litter the artifact:

```bash
sanitized=$(printf '%s' "$pooled" \
  | line-range-check.sh \
      --reviewed-sha "$reviewed_sha" \
      2> >(tee -a "$trace_log_path" >&2))
```

Per-drop audit lines on stderr:

- `lens_hallucinated_line_range: source=<src> file=<path> range=[a,b] actual_lines=<N>`
- `lens_referenced_missing_file: source=<src> file=<path>`

Phase 1.5 external-scrape candidates with `file == "(unknown)"` pass
through untouched. On non-zero exit (bad ref / malformed JSON), log
stderr to `trace.md` and fall through with `$pooled` unchanged —
respecting every candidate is the safe default when the check can't
run.

```bash
if [[ -z "$sanitized" ]]; then
    sanitized="$pooled"
fi
```

**Step 3. Assign monotonic finding ids via the helper:**

```bash
ided=$(printf '%s' "$sanitized" \
  | assign-finding-ids.sh)
```

`assign-finding-ids.sh` sorts by source priority (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5,
L6, L7, external-pr, codex — stable within source = input order
preserved) and assigns `F001…F0NN`. See the helper's header for the
full priority table.

On non-zero exit (malformed pool JSON), log stderr to `trace.md` and
bail — the whole detection phase must re-run because the pool is
corrupt. This is a structural failure, not a per-candidate drop.

**Step 4. Build full schema-valid findings + single batched
`--add-findings` sweep.** `artifact-patch.py --add-findings` validates
each candidate against the full schema, rejects malformed entries
with a per-rejection `add-findings-rejected:` line on stderr, and
commits the accepted batch (if any) in a single atomic write. An
all-rejected batch exits 7 (`EXIT_ALL_REJECTED`) and leaves the
artifact untouched; per-candidate audit lines + the Phase 1.6
`add_findings_total_failures` counter surface that case for the
operator. Partial
candidates (from lenses) and normalizer candidates both need to be
fleshed out to schema shape — the jq builder below does that in one
walk over `$ided`, then pipes a single findings array into the helper
on stdin.

The jq builder canonicalizes `source_family` inline (function
`fam_canonical`, co-located with its callers), shapes each candidate
to the full finding schema, and emits a
`{findings, drift}` object: `findings` is the array we send to the
helper; `drift` is the unknown-family audit lines we append to
`trace.md` so the next mapping-table update surfaces from inspection
rather than a silent drop. Unknown families are tagged
`source_family: "unknown"` (not dropped) — Phase 2 dedup's union of
`source_families` and Phase 3's auto-graduation rule both accept
arbitrary family strings, so the tag propagates harmlessly downstream.

The in-jq `fam_canonical` mapping table MUST stay in sync with
`bin/source-family-map.py`'s `CANONICAL` + `DRIFT_MAP` (the helper
is the alternate canonical reader for ad-hoc debugging; this is the
hot-path Phase 1 reader). `test/smoke.sh` AF-DRIFT enforces the
agreement.

Run steps 3 and 4 in a single `Bash(...)` invocation. If a split is unavoidable, split only after the jq builder runs — write the schema-shaped `$findings_array` (not the pre-builder `$ided`, which the helper rejects as `schema_invalid`) to `$scratch_dir/phase1_findings.json`, then read it back via `--add-findings @<file>` in the next Bash call.

```bash
# Single jq pass: canonicalize source_family, build full schema-shaped
# findings, and identify any unknown-family rows in one walk over the
# pooled candidates. The function definitions live inside the jq
# program so they're co-located with their callers.

For trivial-mode runs (`trivial_mode=true`), the jq builder above
forces `validation_lane="light"` for every candidate — Phase 4b
handles the whole pool. The `$trivial` argjson binding
drives that branch so the stored lane is honest.

Continue-on-error per finding: `--add-findings` rejects bad
candidates by emitting one `add-findings-rejected:` line per drop on
stderr (drained synchronously into `trace.md`) and still
commits the rest of the batch in a single atomic write. The
orchestrator does NOT retry per-candidate — Phase 1.6's summary
surfaces a non-zero `add_findings_rejected` count when drops happen,
and `add_findings_total_failures` (catastrophic case: zero findings
landed despite a non-empty pool) is a distinct loud-failure tag.
`--add-finding` (singular) remains supported.

**`pending_validation` is the Phase-1 parking disposition.** Schema
requires `disposition` non-null, so we can't leave it unset.
`is_actionable: false` + `disposition: "pending_validation"` keeps the
§5.2.1 coupling happy. Phase 3's gate either locks a gate-fail finding
into `below_gate` with a "below validation gate (…)" reason (score N
when the Phase-3 chunk produced a number; "score unavailable …" when
§3.3 set the score to null on parse failure or missing-id),
or leaves it at `pending_validation` for Phase 4 to overwrite with the
final verdict. Pre-existing overrides set `pre_existing_report` at
Phase 3.1 before any of that runs.

### 1.6. Log Phase 1 summary

After every lens result is aggregated and the join step has committed
the pool to the artifact:

```bash
phase_1_elapsed=$(( $(date +%s) - phase_1_start_epoch ))

# Per-lens candidate count via artifact-read
counts_by_family=$(artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" \
  --filter '[.findings[] | .source_families[]?] | group_by(.) | map({key:.[0], value:length}) | from_entries')

total_candidates=$(artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" --filter '.findings | length')

# Surface Phase 1's loud-failure audit tags so the operator sees a non-
# zero count in the trace + phases.jsonl summary rather than having to
# grep trace.md themselves. Both zero on a healthy run.
lens_drops=$(grep -c '^lens_dropped_unparseable:' "$trace_log_path" 2>/dev/null || true)
oc_skipped=$(grep -c '^origin_crosscheck_skipped:' "$trace_log_path" 2>/dev/null || true)
add_findings_rejected=$(grep -c '^add-findings-rejected:' "$trace_log_path" 2>/dev/null || true)
jq_builder_count_drops=$(grep -c '^phase_1_jq_builder_count_drop:' "$trace_log_path" 2>/dev/null || true)
add_findings_total_failures=$(grep -c '^phase_1_add_findings_total_failure:' "$trace_log_path" 2>/dev/null || true)

log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 1 --name detection \
  --elapsed "$phase_1_elapsed" \
  --summary "total=$total_candidates; counts_by_family=$counts_by_family; skipped_lenses=<list-if-any>; lens_drops=$lens_drops; origin_crosscheck_skipped=$oc_skipped; add_findings_rejected=$add_findings_rejected; jq_builder_count_drops=$jq_builder_count_drops; add_findings_total_failures=$add_findings_total_failures"

log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 1 --record "$(jq -nc \
    --arg name detection \
    --argjson elapsed "$phase_1_elapsed" \
    --argjson total "$total_candidates" \
    '{name:$name, elapsed_sec:$elapsed, counts_by_state:{open:$total}, counts_by_disposition:{pending_validation:$total}, delta:"+\($total) open"}')"
```

Under `--ensemble`, `phase_1_elapsed` and Phase 1.5's elapsed will overlap — both phases share a dispatch-turn start boundary; the overlap is the intended observability signal.
