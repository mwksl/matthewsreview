description: Walk interactively through findings /adams-review-fix would skip. Per-finding briefing + options + recommendation, then batch re-render/re-publish and post a decisions-log PR comment.
disable-model-invocation: false
---

Walk the reviewer through every finding in the latest `/adams-review`
artifact that `/adams-review-fix [threshold]` would **skip** at the
chosen threshold: deep-manual, light-manual, light-report, light-auto
that fails the impact_type lane filter, and any `confirmed_auto`
below the score threshold. For each finding, dispatch a Sonnet
briefing agent (claim → options → recommendation), ask the reviewer
to decide, and record a promote (via the shared `promote-core.md`
fragment with `--defer-publish` semantics) or a skip. At the end,
render + publish the updated review once, then POST a separate
decisions-log comment to the PR for audit.

See DESIGN §28 for the full contract and `plans/walkthrough-mode.md`
for the design rationale.

## Arguments

- `[threshold]` (optional, positional) — non-negative integer matching
  the threshold the reviewer plans to use for `/adams-review-fix`.
  Default: 60 (DESIGN §13.2). Determines which `confirmed_auto`
  findings would "already be fixed" by the fix command and are
  therefore excluded from the walkthrough scope.

## What it does

1. Parses the threshold.
2. Locates the artifact for the current branch.
3. Computes three walkthrough scopes (qualifying / full / pre-existing).
4. Shows a pre-flight summary + asks the reviewer which tier to walk
   (default **Qualifying**; **Full skip set** is the opt-in for
   auditing Phase-3-demoted findings).
5. For each finding in the chosen tier:
   - Dispatches a Sonnet briefing sub-agent → `{summary, options[], recommendation}`.
   - Presents the briefing and asks the reviewer which option to pick
     (or "Edit the fix hint" to override the recommended option's hint).
   - Dispatches a promote (patch + trace, no render/publish) or a skip.
6. Re-renders `artifact.md` once.
7. Re-publishes the main review comment once.
8. For each `pre_existing_report` finding (PR mode only): offers to
   draft + create a GitHub issue, one by one.
9. Posts a new "Walkthrough decisions" comment to the PR with the
   full log of what was promoted / skipped / issues filed / why.
10. Appends a `## walkthrough (<ts>)` block to `trace.md`.
11. Prints a user-visible summary.

Does NOT run `/adams-review-fix`. Does NOT surface `disposition=disproven`
findings (those require an explicit `/adams-review-promote <id> --force`).

## Execution

Work through the steps below in order. Capture each named variable
into your working context. Build a TaskList that mirrors these step
headings.

### 1. Parse arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` (whitespace-split):

- First token that parses as a non-negative integer → `threshold`.
- Any other token → stop and ask the user to clarify.

If no integer was provided, `threshold=60` (DESIGN §13.2). Record in
your working context.

### 2. Locate the artifact

```bash
reviews_root="${ADAMS_REVIEW_REVIEWS_ROOT:-$HOME/.adams-reviews}"
head_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
repo_slug=$(~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/repo-slug.sh --repo-root "$repo_root")
latest_path="$reviews_root/$repo_slug/$head_branch/latest.txt"
```

If `latest.txt` is missing or empty, error-as-prompt:

> ERROR: no review found for branch `$head_branch` under
> `$reviews_root/$repo_slug/`.
> Action: run /adams-review against this branch first.

Otherwise:

```bash
review_id=$(tr -d '[:space:]' < "$latest_path")
review_dir="$reviews_root/$repo_slug/$head_branch/$review_id"
artifact_path="$review_dir/artifact.json"
trace_log_path="$review_dir/trace.md"
```

Capture paths. Schema-validate:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-validate.sh --path "$artifact_path"
```

On non-zero: surface the validator stderr and abort.

Extract `mode` and `pr_number` from the validated artifact now — both
are needed by §3's mode-aware exit checks, §4's preflight messaging,
§6.2's publish call, §6.5's issue-filing gate, and §7's decisions-log
POST. Reading them once at the top of the run avoids the historical
bug where §6.5 ran before §6.2's extraction and found `mode` unset:

```bash
mode=$(jq -r '.mode' "$artifact_path")
pr_number=$(jq -r '.pr_number // empty' "$artifact_path")
```

(`comment_id` is extracted later in §6.2 — it's only read by the
publish call, and deferring it keeps the "reviewer cancelled early"
paths from unnecessarily reading it.)

### 3. Compute walkthrough scope

The walkthrough surfaces findings `/adams-review-fix` would SKIP at
`$threshold`. Compute three parallel id sets so the preflight at step
4 can offer a tiered choice (default Qualifying) and step 6.5 can
handle `pre_existing_report` findings on a separate track.

**`scope_full_ids`** — the inverse of the Phase 8 eligibility selector
at `09-fix-execution.md` step 8.1 (minus terminal + already-promoted),
**further reduced by excluding `pre_existing_report`** which is routed
exclusively to §6.5's issue-filing phase and is never surfaced for
promotion (a user may still direct Claude off-menu to promote a
specific pre-existing finding; §6.5 defends against the double-
processing that would otherwise create). **Keep the Phase-8-inverse
shape in sync with `09-fix-execution.md`; the pre-existing exclusion
is specific to the walkthrough.**

```bash
scope_full_ids=$(jq -r --argjson thr "$threshold" '
    [.findings[]
     # Not terminal: skip resolved / disproven / pending_validation.
     | select(.current_state == "open")
     | select(.disposition != "resolved")
     | select(.disposition != "disproven")
     | select(.disposition != "pending_validation")
     # Pre-existing findings are handled only via §6.5 issue filing;
     # never walked for promotion. (See header comment above.)
     | select(.disposition != "pre_existing_report")
     # Skip already-promoted (human_confirmation set). Re-running the
     # walkthrough mid-session naturally picks up where it left off.
     | select(.human_confirmation == null)
     # Include iff the Phase 8 gate would skip it — the inverse of
     # 09-fix-execution.md step 8.1 (§13.1, §13.2). Note: jq's `not`
     # is a filter (pipe into it), not a function.
     | select(
         (
           (.disposition == "confirmed_auto" or .disposition == "partial" or .disposition == "regression")
           and (
             (.impact_type == "correctness" or .impact_type == "security")
             and (.score_phase4 != null and .score_phase4 >= $thr)
           )
         ) | not
       )
     | .id
    ] | join(",")
' "$artifact_path")
```

**`scope_qualifying_ids`** — `scope_full_ids` minus the two
dispositions that dilute the signal: `below_gate` (Phase 3 already
judged these low-impact × low-confidence) and `pre_existing_report`
(routed to the dedicated issue-filing phase at step 6.5). This is
the new default tier.

```bash
scope_qualifying_ids=$(jq -r --argjson thr "$threshold" '
    [.findings[]
     | select(.current_state == "open")
     | select(.disposition != "resolved")
     | select(.disposition != "disproven")
     | select(.disposition != "pending_validation")
     | select(.disposition != "below_gate")
     | select(.disposition != "pre_existing_report")
     | select(.human_confirmation == null)
     | select(
         (
           (.disposition == "confirmed_auto" or .disposition == "partial" or .disposition == "regression")
           and (
             (.impact_type == "correctness" or .impact_type == "security")
             and (.score_phase4 != null and .score_phase4 >= $thr)
           )
         ) | not
       )
     | .id
    ] | join(",")
' "$artifact_path")
```

**`scope_preexisting_ids`** — open `pre_existing_report` findings,
independent of the fix-skip logic. Feeds step 6.5 (issue filing).
Already-promoted pre-existing findings are excluded for the same
resume-cleanly reason as the other scopes.

```bash
scope_preexisting_ids=$(jq -r '
    [.findings[]
     | select(.current_state == "open")
     | select(.disposition == "pre_existing_report")
     | select(.human_confirmation == null)
     | .id
    ] | join(",")
' "$artifact_path")
```

Counts:

```bash
count_ids() {
    # $1: comma-separated id string
    if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then echo 0; else awk -F, '{print NF; exit}' <<<"$1"; fi
}

scope_full_count=$(count_ids "$scope_full_ids")
scope_qualifying_count=$(count_ids "$scope_qualifying_ids")
scope_preexisting_count=$(count_ids "$scope_preexisting_ids")
```

If **all three** are empty, exit cleanly:

```
No findings to walk through at threshold=$threshold.

Either every finding is already auto-eligible (run /adams-review-fix
$threshold to apply them) or the review has no actionable findings
left. Nothing to do.
```

Exit 0.

If `scope_full_count == 0` AND `scope_preexisting_count > 0` AND
`mode == "local"`, also exit cleanly — the only remaining work
(pre-existing issue filing at §6.5) requires a PR to link against, so
local mode can't deliver it and falling through to §4 would promise
work the run can't perform:

```
$scope_preexisting_count pre-existing finding(s) in this review, but
local mode has no PR to file issues against. Re-run
/adams-review-walkthrough on the PR branch (or use the GitHub UI)
to file them. Nothing to do here.
```

Exit 0. If `scope_full_count == 0` but `scope_preexisting_count > 0`
AND `mode == "pr"`, fall through to step 4 anyway — the preflight
will note that the walk has no scope but the issue-filing phase still
has work to offer.

### 4. Pre-flight summary + go/no-go

Before the preview table, render this short preamble so the reviewer
understands what "scope" means here. This is the preventive-docs fix
for the historical "which gate?" confusion (see CLAUDE.md §Score
gates → Gate terminology):

```markdown
**Understanding the scope.** Three different gates govern this pipeline:

- **Phase 3 scoring gate (45)** — filters candidates into validation.
  Failures get `disposition=below_gate` and no `score_phase4`.
- **Phase 4 confirmation gate (45/60/75)** — maps `score_phase4` into
  `disproven` / `uncertain` / `confirmed_*`.
- **Phase 8 fix gate (default 60)** — what `/adams-review-fix` touches:
  confirmed_auto + deep lane + score ≥ threshold.

The walkthrough surfaces what Phase 8 would SKIP. `below_gate` is a
**disposition name**, not a threshold — Phase 3 already demoted those
as low-impact × low-confidence. Pre-existing findings (`pre_existing_report`)
are handled on a separate track at the end of the run (file GitHub
issues for base-branch bugs instead of trying to fix them here).
```

Render a compact preview table covering all of `scope_full_ids` (so
the reviewer sees the full picture before picking a tier). Add a
`tier` column that categorizes each row:

- `qualifying` — would be included in the default tier
- `below_gate` — Phase 3 demoted
- `pre_existing` — routed to step 6.5 issue filing (not walked)

```bash
preview=$(jq -r --arg ids "$scope_full_ids" --arg preids "$scope_preexisting_ids" --argjson thr "$threshold" '
    # Preview covers both walk-eligible ids (scope_full_ids) AND
    # pre-existing ids (scope_preexisting_ids) so the reviewer sees
    # every finding that either tier or §6.5 will touch. split("")
    # on an empty string yields [""]; the inner select filters that
    # out via the non-empty-id guard.
    (($ids | split(",")) + ($preids | split(","))) as $want
    | [.findings[]
       | select(.id as $id | ($id | length) > 0 and ($want | index($id)))
       | {
        id,
        tier: (
          if (.disposition == "below_gate") then "below_gate"
          elif (.disposition == "pre_existing_report") then "pre_existing"
          else "qualifying" end
        ),
        lane: .validation_lane,
        impact: .impact_type,
        disposition,
        score: (.score_phase4 // .score_phase3 // "—"),
        file: .file,
        claim_first_line: (.claim | split("\n") | .[0])
      }]
    | (["# ", "tier", "lane", "impact", "disposition", "score", "file", "claim"] | @tsv),
      (.[] | [.id, .tier, .lane, .impact, .disposition, (.score|tostring), .file, .claim_first_line] | @tsv)
' "$artifact_path")
```

If `scope_preexisting_count > 0`, mention it explicitly under the
table: "N pre-existing finding(s) are excluded from both walk tiers
and will be offered as GitHub issues at the end of the run." This
prevents the "where did F005 go?" variant of the same confusion.

Then dispatch `AskUserQuestion` with three options. Default
highlighted on Qualifying:

- "⭐ Qualifying only — walk $scope_qualifying_count finding(s) (recommended)"
- "Full skip set — walk $scope_full_count finding(s) (includes \`below_gate\`)"
- "Cancel — don't change anything"

Edge case: if `scope_qualifying_count == 0` and `scope_full_count > 0`,
the only useful walk choice is "Full." Offer only "Full" and "Cancel"
in that case — no recommendation star, since Qualifying is empty.
If `scope_full_count == 0` AND `scope_preexisting_count > 0` (only
pre-existing findings remain), skip the walk `AskUserQuestion`
entirely and set `scope_tier="none"` directly. Print a one-line note
like "No walk scope at threshold=$threshold; jumping to pre-existing
issue filing." Then continue normally: the timestamp/reviewer
capture below runs, step 5 loop iterates 0 findings (because
`scope_ids=""`), §6 tallies to all zeroes, §6's existing
`promote_count == 0` guard skips §6.1/§6.2, `scope_tier_title` is
derived, and §6.5 takes over. The §7 guard
("decisions empty AND issues_filed empty → skip POST") handles the
case where the reviewer then skips issue filing too.

Bind the `AskUserQuestion` result to `$scope_tier` (one of
`qualifying` / `full` / `cancel`). For the walk-skip edge case
(scope_full_count == 0, AskUserQuestion bypassed), set
`scope_tier="none"` directly. Then map it onto the loop variables
the rest of the command uses:

```bash
case "$scope_tier" in
    qualifying)
        scope_ids="$scope_qualifying_ids"
        scope_count="$scope_qualifying_count" ;;
    full)
        scope_ids="$scope_full_ids"
        scope_count="$scope_full_count" ;;
    none)
        # Walk skipped (only pre-existing remain). Bind empty so
        # §6 arithmetic (unreviewed_count = scope_count - …) works.
        scope_ids=""
        scope_count=0 ;;
    cancel)
        # exit 0 with a one-line note; no mutation
        ;;
esac
```

If the reviewer picks Cancel, exit 0 with a one-line note. No mutation.

Before entering the loop, capture the session timestamp + reviewer
identity. Used by step 7 (decisions-log header) and step 8 (trace
block header). Capturing before the loop ensures a single consistent
value across the session even though promote-core re-resolves
`$reviewer` per iteration:

```bash
walkthrough_ts=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
reviewer=$(git config user.email 2>/dev/null)
[[ -z "$reviewer" ]] && reviewer=$(git config user.name 2>/dev/null)
[[ -z "$reviewer" ]] && reviewer="unknown"
```

### 5. Per-finding loop

Initialize an in-memory decisions array in your working context. Each
entry records the full outcome of one finding — whether promoted,
skipped, or interrupted — so step 7's decisions-log comment has the
complete audit trail:

```
decisions = []   # list of {finding_id, action, option_label, option_title, edited_hint?, reason, fix_hint?, prior_disposition, prior_score, ts}
```

Iterate `scope_ids` **in the order returned by the jq** (no re-sort —
that's the order the reviewer saw in the preview table at step 4).
For each `$finding_id`:

#### 5.1. Fetch the finding JSON

```bash
finding_json=$(~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-read.sh \
    --path "$artifact_path" \
    --filter ".findings[] | select(.id == \"$finding_id\")")
```

Capture the `file` and `line_range` for the briefing agent's file
snippet request:

```bash
f_file=$(jq -r '.file' <<<"$finding_json")
f_line_start=$(jq -r '.line_range[0]' <<<"$finding_json")
f_line_end=$(jq -r '.line_range[1]' <<<"$finding_json")
f_disp=$(jq -r '.disposition' <<<"$finding_json")
f_score=$(jq -r '.score_phase4 // .score_phase3 // "null"' <<<"$finding_json")
f_impact=$(jq -r '.impact_type' <<<"$finding_json")
f_claim=$(jq -r '.claim' <<<"$finding_json")
```

#### 5.2. Dispatch the briefing sub-agent

One `Agent` tool-use per finding. Model: `sonnet`. Budget: ~3-5k
tokens. Prompt (see DESIGN §28.4):

> You are a code-review triage briefer. The reviewer is walking
> through one finding and needs:
>
>   1. A 2-4 sentence summary of what the finding is about and what
>      the validator concluded (include disproven halves, if any).
>   2. 2-5 concrete **fix-variant** options the reviewer can pick
>      from, each with a one-line title and 1-2 sentence detail. Each
>      option represents a different way to fix the finding (e.g.
>      "update the docstring" vs "update the code" for a doc/code
>      mismatch; "add parameter validation" vs "tighten the type
>      signature" for a type-safety finding). Do NOT emit a generic
>      "skip" or "defer" option — the walkthrough adds its own
>      "Skip this finding" and "Stop the walkthrough" options after
>      yours, and routing ambiguity between the two skip paths causes
>      fallback-prompt UX glitches. If no fix variant seems right,
>      emit only one or two weak-conviction options and let your
>      recommendation say so in the rationale — the reviewer can still
>      pick the walkthrough's Skip.
>      **For `confirmed_manual` and `confirmed_report` findings:**
>      propose a best-effort fix hint anyway. These are above the
>      Phase 4 confirmation threshold (score ≥ 60) — the validator
>      said the finding is real, just not mechanically trivial (manual)
>      or not worth a fix (report-only). If a concrete fix path exists,
>      emit it as your top option with a specific `fix_hint_if_picked`.
>      If you genuinely can't see a clean fix (rare), emit one or two
>      weak-conviction options and say so in your recommendation
>      rationale — the reviewer can still pick Skip.
>   3. A recommendation: which option + rationale + a specific
>      `fix_hint` string suitable to pass to the Phase 8 fix-group
>      agent. Include negative constraints when over-engineering is a
>      risk ("do NOT add a new flag"; "do NOT change the code").
>
> Context (read the repo via the Read tool for the file snippet):
>
>   - Finding JSON: <paste $finding_json verbatim>
>   - File: $f_file (lines $f_line_start-$f_line_end, plus ±30 of
>     context — use Read)
>   - Repo root CLAUDE.md: read once and extract any rules that
>     cite $f_file or the same pattern as $f_claim.
>   - Other findings on the same file: <filter artifact-read by .file == $f_file>
>
> Return strict JSON matching:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "summary": "2-4 sentences",
>   "options": [
>     {"label": "A", "title": "...", "detail": "...", "fix_hint_if_picked": "..."},
>     ...
>   ],
>   "recommendation": {"label": "A" | "B" | ..., "rationale": "..."}
> }
> ```
>
> Hard rules:
>
>   - Emit ONE JSON object only. No surrounding prose. No code fences.
>   - Labels are single uppercase letters starting from A.
>   - Every option MUST have a non-null `fix_hint_if_picked` string
>     (every option is a fix variant — see rule 2 above). A null
>     hint would fall through to promote-core's fallback heuristic
>     prompt and break the walkthrough's single-question-per-finding
>     rhythm.
>   - Prefer specific `fix_hint` strings with negative constraints.
>     Avoid vague hints like "fix the docstring" — say what to change
>     and what not to change.

Parse the returned text as JSON (one retry on parse failure with an
"emit JSON only; no surrounding prose" reminder). On second failure,
log to `trace.md` under tag `walkthrough_briefing_failed:$finding_id`
and fall through to a degraded UX: present the raw finding JSON with
options `Skip (briefing failed)` / `Promote anyway (no fix-hint)` /
`Stop the walkthrough`.

Log the agent's token count to `tokens.jsonl` per §11 / §24.4.
Extract the agent id and token count from the Agent tool result's
`<usage>` block. When the block is missing or unparseable, pass the
literal `null` for tokens (same fallback pattern as §8.6 / Phase 8
fix-group logging) — token tracking is observability, not
correctness:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/log-tokens.sh \
    --review-dir "$review_dir" \
    --phase walkthrough --agent-role briefing \
    --agent-id <id-from-Agent-result> \
    --model sonnet --finding-id "$finding_id" \
    --tokens <N or null>
```

#### 5.3. Render the briefing to chat

Present the briefing as a markdown block the reviewer can read at a
glance:

```markdown
## $finding_id — <first line of claim>

**File:** `$f_file:$f_line_start-$f_line_end`
**Score:** $f_score · **Impact:** $f_impact · **Disposition:** $f_disp

**What it's about:** <briefing.summary>

**Options:**

- **A. <options[0].title>** — <options[0].detail>
- **B. <options[1].title>** — <options[1].detail>
- ...

**Recommendation:** **<recommendation.label>** — <recommendation.rationale>
```

#### 5.4. Ask for a decision

Dispatch `AskUserQuestion` with options built from the briefing:

- One option per `briefing.options[]` entry, labeled with its letter
  and title ("**A.** <title>").
- **"✎ Edit the fix hint (for the recommended option)"** — picks the
  briefing's recommended option but overrides its
  `fix_hint_if_picked` with reviewer-supplied text. On selection,
  dispatch one follow-up `AskUserQuestion` (free-form) capturing the
  override string. Use when the recommended option's direction is
  right but the hint wording needs tightening or negative constraints
  added.
- One "Skip this finding" option.
- One "Stop the walkthrough (finalize now with decisions made so
  far)" option.

Label the briefing's recommended option visually (e.g. prepend
"⭐ (recommended)" to the title) so the reviewer can accept it with
one click.

#### 5.5. Dispatch per choice

**If the reviewer picked a promote option (or Edit the fix hint):**

For a regular promote option, `$fix_hint` comes from the option's
`fix_hint_if_picked`. For "Edit the fix hint," `$fix_hint` is the
reviewer's follow-up free-form string and `$option_label` /
`$option_title` are the originally-recommended option's values
(so the audit trail shows which direction the hint was edited for).
Set `edited_hint=true` in that case; `edited_hint=false` (or absent)
otherwise.

Set ambient context for the shared promote-core fragment (steps 3,
4, 4.5, 5, 6, 9 — the body of which is inlined once at the end of
this file for reference and for Claude Code's command-load
preprocessor to resolve):

```bash
fix_hint="$briefing_option.fix_hint_if_picked"          # or reviewer override when edited_hint
reason="walkthrough: $finding_id — picked option $label ($title)"
[[ "${edited_hint:-false}" == "true" ]] && reason="$reason · hint edited"
force=false
defer_publish=true
```

(Note: `${edited_hint:+...}` would expand for the string `"false"`
since `:+` tests emptiness, not boolean — we need an explicit
string compare against `"true"`.)

Then execute the shared fragment's steps 3, 4, 4.5 (the prompt is
skipped because `$fix_hint` is always non-empty — the briefer at
§5.2 is hard-constrained to emit a non-null `fix_hint_if_picked` on
every option, and the edit-hint path is a free-form override that's
likewise always populated), 5, 6, and 9 for this finding id. The
fragment reads `$finding_id`, `$reason`, `$fix_hint`, `$force`,
`$artifact_path`, and `$trace_log_path` from this ambient context.

**The fragment runs once per iteration** — read it as the per-finding
playbook, not as a single-shot action. Each iteration patches one
finding + appends one `## promote` block to `trace.md`; render and
publish stay deferred until step 6 of this command.

Capture the `$ts`, `$curr_disp`, `$curr_score` the fragment emits
for this iteration. Append to `decisions`:

```
{
  finding_id: $finding_id,
  action: "promote",
  option_label: <briefing label>,
  option_title: <briefing title>,
  edited_hint: <true if the reviewer picked Edit the fix hint, else false>,
  reason: $reason,
  fix_hint: $fix_hint,          # non-empty (option default or reviewer override)
  prior_disposition: $curr_disp,
  prior_score: $curr_score,
  ts: $ts
}
```

**If the reviewer picked "Skip this finding":**

```
decisions += {
  finding_id: $finding_id,
  action: "skip",
  option_label: null,
  option_title: "skipped",
  reason: "reviewer skipped during walkthrough",
  prior_disposition: $f_disp,
  prior_score: $f_score,
  ts: <now>
}
```

No mutation. Append a terse line to `trace.md` under the run's
walkthrough entry (see step 8 below).

**If the reviewer picked "Stop the walkthrough":**

Break out of the loop immediately. Record a final `decisions` entry:

```
decisions += {
  finding_id: $finding_id,
  action: "stop",
  option_label: null,
  option_title: "walkthrough stopped by reviewer",
  reason: "reviewer requested stop",
  prior_disposition: $f_disp,
  prior_score: $f_score,
  ts: <now>
}
```

Note: the current finding (`$finding_id`) is NOT mutated — "stop"
is an explicit no-op on the current id. Only the previously-decided
findings earlier in the loop have been promoted.

Proceed to step 6 (finalize) with whatever decisions have accumulated.

#### 5.6. Between iterations

Append one terse line to the user-visible chat stream so the reviewer
has running feedback (e.g. "F023 promoted (option A — update
docstring). 4 of 10 processed."). No per-iteration render or publish.

### 6. Finalize — render + publish main comment

First, tally the decision counts from the `decisions[]` array so step
7 (decisions-log) and step 8 (trace block) can reference them:

```bash
promote_count=$(jq -s '[.[] | select(.action == "promote")] | length' <<<"$(printf '%s\n' "${decisions[@]}")")
skip_count=$(jq   -s '[.[] | select(.action == "skip")]    | length' <<<"$(printf '%s\n' "${decisions[@]}")")
stop_count=$(jq   -s '[.[] | select(.action == "stop")]    | length' <<<"$(printf '%s\n' "${decisions[@]}")")
unreviewed_count=$(( scope_count - promote_count - skip_count - stop_count ))
```

`$unreviewed_count` is non-zero only when the reviewer picked "Stop
the walkthrough" before reaching every scoped finding. Reported
separately so the decisions-log (§7.1) and user-visible summary
(§9) can't misleadingly imply the reviewer walked all scope_count
findings.

(`mode` and `pr_number` were already extracted in §2 and are in ambient
context. `comment_id` is deferred to §6.2 where the publish call uses
it.)

Guard: if `promote_count == 0` (all skip/stop), there's nothing to
re-render or re-publish. Skip steps 6.1 and 6.2; proceed to step 6.5
(pre-existing issue filing) and then step 7 (decisions-log comment).
Issue filing is independent of walk activity — a reviewer who skipped
every walk finding may still want to file pre-existing issues. The
scope filter + preview table already showed the user what's in the
backlog; a decisions-log with "skipped all 10" is still useful audit.

Also derive `scope_tier_title` here for §7.1:

```bash
case "$scope_tier" in
    qualifying) scope_tier_title="Qualifying" ;;
    full)       scope_tier_title="Full skip set" ;;
    none)       scope_tier_title="Pre-existing only" ;;
esac
```

#### 6.1. Re-tally `subagent_tokens` + `orchestrator_tokens`, then re-render `artifact.md`

Re-tally first so the rendered report (and the PR comment update in
6.2) reflect cumulative sub-agent + orchestrator spend. Each
walkthrough briefer dispatched in the per-finding loop already logged
itself to `tokens.jsonl` (§24.4); the orchestrator transcript on disk
already captured every main-session turn. Both helpers are pure
readbacks:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/tally-subagent-tokens.sh \
    --tokens-log "$review_dir/tokens.jsonl" \
    --artifact   "$artifact_path" \
    2>>"$trace_log_path" || printf 'walkthrough_tally_failed\n' >> "$trace_log_path"

~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/orchestrator-tokens.sh \
    --artifact "$artifact_path" \
    --since    "$review_started_at" \
    2>>"$trace_log_path" || printf 'walkthrough_orchestrator_tally_failed\n' >> "$trace_log_path"

~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-render.py \
    --input "$artifact_path" \
    --output "$review_dir/artifact.md"
```

Tally failures are non-fatal (observability, not correctness). On
render non-zero: log stderr to `trace.md` with tag
`walkthrough_render_failed`. Continue to step 6.2 — the artifact
patches stand; the user can manually re-render.

Issue-filing in §6.5 below dispatches another batch of sub-agents
after this point; those land in `tokens.jsonl` (and generate further
orchestrator turns) but the walkthrough does not re-render after §6.5,
so their cost will only surface on the next `/adams-review-fix` (or
subsequent `/adams-review-add` / `/adams-review-walkthrough`) run when
that command re-tallies. This is acceptable — issue-filing is terminal
and no further re-publish follows it.

#### 6.2. Re-publish the main review comment (PR mode only)

`mode` and `pr_number` were already extracted in §2. Extract
`comment_id` here — it's only used by the publish call:

```bash
comment_id=$(jq -r '.comment_id // empty' "$artifact_path")
```

If `mode == "pr"` AND `pr_number` is non-empty:

```bash
publish_args=(
    --mode pr
    --review-id "$review_id"
    --pr "$pr_number"
    --repo-slug "$repo_slug"
    --branch "$head_branch"
    --review-dir "$review_dir"
)
[[ -n "$comment_id" ]] && publish_args+=(--comment-id "$comment_id")

~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-publish.sh "${publish_args[@]}"
```

If `mode == "local"`: call with `--mode local --review-id "$review_id"
--review-dir "$review_dir"` (no-op that appends a trace line).

On non-zero: log stderr to `trace.md` with tag
`walkthrough_publish_failed`. Continue to step 6.5 — the downstream
steps are still worth running even if the main-comment PATCH failed.

### 6.5. File GitHub issues for pre-existing findings

Skip entirely when ANY of the following hold:
- `mode == "local"` — no PR to link the issue back to.
- `scope_preexisting_count == 0` — nothing to file.
- `pr_number` is empty — defensive; in pr mode this should always be
  populated but we avoid calling `gh issue create` with an empty
  link in the drafted body.

(Local mode has no PR → no natural "parent" issue; the trace entry at
step 8 remains the sole audit record.)

Rationale: `pre_existing_report` findings originate in code that
pre-dates this PR (per the §13 pre-existing override). They're not
fixable in the current change, so bundling them with promote-eligible
findings in the §5 loop forced awkward "skip" decisions every run.
Filing a GitHub issue moves them to a durable tracking surface outside
the review artifact.

Initialize an `issues_filed=[]` array in ambient context. Each entry:
`{finding_id, issue_url, title, ts}`.

Cache the owner/repo string once (used per iteration):

```bash
repo_name_with_owner=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null)
```

If `repo_name_with_owner` is empty (no remote, or `gh` auth issue),
log to `trace.md` under tag `walkthrough_repo_resolve_failed`, skip
§6.5 entirely, and continue to §7. `gh issue create --repo ""` would
fail per-iteration with a confusing error; a single upfront skip is
cleaner.

#### 6.5.1. One-shot gate prompt

Dispatch `AskUserQuestion`:

- "File all $scope_preexisting_count issue(s)"
- "Pick a subset"
- "Skip — don't file any"

If the reviewer picks "Pick a subset," dispatch a follow-up
`AskUserQuestion` with the finding ids as multi-select options
(fall back to a free-form comma-separated id list with validation
when multi-select isn't available). Capture the selected ids into
`filing_ids` (comma-separated). "File all" sets
`filing_ids=$scope_preexisting_ids`. "Skip" leaves `filing_ids`
empty.

If `filing_ids` is empty (either the reviewer chose "Skip" or
selected zero items in the subset picker), skip the §6.5.2 loop
entirely and proceed to §7. `issues_filed[]` remains empty and the
§9 summary's "not filed" note will fire.

#### 6.5.2. Per-selected finding: draft + confirm + create

Iterate `filing_ids` in the order returned. For each `$finding_id`:

**Fetch the finding JSON and per-finding variables** (same pattern as
§5.1). These MUST be re-extracted inside the §6.5.2 loop — they are
local to each iteration. If §6.5 runs after the §5 walk loop,
`$f_file` / `$f_line_start` / `$f_line_end` otherwise carry the last
walked finding's values (wrong file in the draft) or are unset when
the walk was cancelled (undefined-variable expansion):

```bash
finding_json=$(~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-read.sh \
    --path "$artifact_path" \
    --filter ".findings[] | select(.id == \"$finding_id\")")
f_file=$(jq -r '.file' <<<"$finding_json")
f_line_start=$(jq -r '.line_range[0]' <<<"$finding_json")
f_line_end=$(jq -r '.line_range[1]' <<<"$finding_json")
f_claim=$(jq -r '.claim' <<<"$finding_json")
f_hc=$(jq -c '.human_confirmation // null' <<<"$finding_json")
```

**Guard: skip findings already promoted off-menu.** The default flow
never promotes a `pre_existing_report` finding (scope_full_ids excludes
them per §3). But a user can direct Claude mid-run to promote a
specific pre-existing finding as an explicit override. In that case
the finding has `human_confirmation != null` now, even though
`scope_preexisting_ids` (captured at §3 before the override) still
lists its id. Filing a GitHub issue for a finding that's also queued
for auto-fix double-processes it:

```bash
if [[ "$f_hc" != "null" ]]; then
    {
        printf '## walkthrough_issue_filing_skipped (%s)\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
        printf 'finding=%s reason=already_promoted_off_menu\n\n' "$finding_id"
    } >> "$trace_log_path"
    # One-line chat update mirroring the §5.6 cadence:
    #   "F026 skipped: already promoted earlier this run."
    continue
fi
```

Do NOT add an `issues_filed[]` entry for a skipped finding — the array
records what was actually filed, not what was considered.

**Dispatch a Sonnet drafting agent.** Model: `sonnet`. Budget: ~2-3k
tokens. Prompt:

> You are drafting a GitHub issue for a code-review finding that
> pre-dates the current PR (`pre_existing_report`). The reviewer
> wants a concise, actionable issue that someone triaging the
> backlog can read cold.
>
> Return strict JSON matching:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "title": "<70 chars, imperative or descriptive; no issue #, no trailing period>",
>   "body": "<markdown body; sections: Summary, Location, Evidence, Suggested direction>"
>
> }
> ```
>
> Hard rules:
>
>   - Emit ONE JSON object only. No surrounding prose. No outer code
>     fences on the JSON itself (the `body` string may contain inner
>     fenced code blocks — those are fine).
>   - Body must include a line like `File: <file>:<line_start>-<line_end>`
>     and a "Discovered during" sentence naming this PR number
>     (see context).
>   - Keep the body under 40 lines. Link to the PR once; don't
>     replicate the finding JSON.
>
> Context:
>
>   - Finding JSON: <paste $finding_json verbatim>
>   - PR: #$pr_number in $repo_name_with_owner
>   - File: $f_file (lines $f_line_start-$f_line_end, plus ±20 of
>     context via Read)

Parse the returned text as JSON (one retry on parse failure). On
second failure, log to `trace.md` under tag
`walkthrough_issue_draft_failed:$finding_id` and surface a degraded
UX: offer `Skip this finding` or `Write body free-form` (captured
via one `AskUserQuestion` free-form follow-up).

Log the drafting agent's tokens per §5.2 convention:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/log-tokens.sh \
    --review-dir "$review_dir" \
    --phase walkthrough --agent-role pre_existing_issue_draft \
    --agent-id <id-from-Agent-result> \
    --model sonnet --finding-id "$finding_id" \
    --tokens <N or null>
```

**Render the draft** as a markdown block to chat:

```markdown
## Pre-existing issue draft — $finding_id

**Title:** <draft.title>

---

<draft.body>
```

**Ask for the next action.** `AskUserQuestion`:

- "Create issue"
- "Edit the body first"
- "Skip this finding"

For "Edit the body first," dispatch one follow-up `AskUserQuestion`
(free-form) capturing the replacement body, then re-render and loop
back to this same `AskUserQuestion`. Two edit rounds max per finding
to keep cadence predictable — after two, auto-offer Create/Skip only.

**For "Skip this finding,"** continue to the next finding in
`filing_ids`. The finding remains open in the artifact with its
existing `pre_existing_report` disposition. No trace entry is
written per-skip — the `pre_existing_issues:` block in §8 lists
what was *filed*, and the artifact's full `pre_existing_report`
set (discoverable via `artifact-read.sh`) implicitly shows what
was available, so absence = skipped.

**For "Create issue":**

```bash
body_tmp=$(mktemp -t adams-walkthrough-issue.XXXXXX)
err_tmp=$(mktemp -t adams-walkthrough-gh-err.XXXXXX)
# write $draft_body (possibly user-edited) to $body_tmp
# Capture gh's full stdout so we can detect failure by its own exit
# status — piping through awk would swallow gh's non-zero exit
# because bash without `set -o pipefail` reports only the pipeline's
# last command's exit, and awk 'END{print}' always succeeds.
gh_stdout=$(gh issue create \
    --repo "$repo_name_with_owner" \
    --title "$draft_title" \
    --body-file "$body_tmp" 2>"$err_tmp")
gh_rc=$?
rm -f "$body_tmp"
issue_url=$(awk 'END{print}' <<<"$gh_stdout")
```

`gh issue create` emits the URL as its final stdout line on success;
`awk 'END{print}'` extracts it in a separate step so `gh_rc` is
gh's own exit, not awk's. (`tail` is not in this command's
`allowed-tools`; `awk` is.) Stderr is captured to `$err_tmp` — a
`mktemp` file, not `/tmp/...$$`, because the orchestrator may invoke
successive bash calls with different PIDs, and `mktemp` gives a
stable path for the whole step.

If `gh_rc != 0`, read `$err_tmp`, log under tag
`walkthrough_issue_filed_failed:$finding_id` with the drafted
title + body (for manual recovery), `rm -f "$err_tmp"`, and continue
to the next finding. Do not abort the whole step on a single `gh`
failure. On success, also `rm -f "$err_tmp"`.

On success, append to `issues_filed`:

```
{
  finding_id: $finding_id,
  issue_url: $issue_url,
  title: $draft_title,
  ts: <now>
}
```

Print a one-line chat update: "Filed $finding_id → $issue_url.
Ns processed of M." Mirrors the §5.6 cadence for the main loop.

Note on partial runs: any issues filed before an interruption stand
— these are durable side effects. If the reviewer later re-runs
`/adams-review-walkthrough`, the same `pre_existing_report` findings
will re-appear (they don't set `human_confirmation`, and the
artifact has no `filed_issue_url` field per our no-schema-change
decision). The reviewer can close duplicates manually on GitHub. The
trace entry at step 8 records which findings were filed in each run,
so cross-referencing is straightforward.

### 7. Post the decisions-log PR comment

Skip entirely when `mode == "local"` (no PR to comment on — the trace
entry at step 8 is the audit record in local mode).

Also skip when `${#decisions[@]} == 0` AND `${#issues_filed[@]} == 0`
— there's nothing to report (the reviewer cancelled before walking
anything AND filed no pre-existing issues). Step 8's trace line is
still written so the run is auditable locally.

In PR mode, render a decisions-log markdown block from `decisions`
and POST it as a NEW PR comment (separate from the main review
comment). DO NOT mutate `artifact.comment_id` — that stays pointing
at the main review comment so future `/adams-review-fix` and
`/adams-review-promote` runs edit the right comment.

#### 7.1. Build the decisions-log markdown

One header block, then one subsection per decision in the order they
were made. Use the ids and titles verbatim from the `decisions[]`
array.

```markdown
<!-- adams-review-walkthrough-v1 -->
### Walkthrough decisions

`$review_id` · scope=**$scope_tier** · threshold=$threshold · reviewer=$reviewer · ts=$walkthrough_ts

Walking the **$scope_tier_title** scope: of **$scope_count** non-auto-eligible finding(s), **$promote_count promoted**, **$skip_count skipped**, **$stop_count stopped**, **$unreviewed_count unreviewed**.

Promoted findings will be picked up by the next `/adams-review-fix $threshold` run via the `human_confirmation` bypass (DESIGN §27.6).

---

#### Promoted

- **F003** — [first line of claim] · option **A** (Update the docstring to match the code)
  - **Why:** <option.detail> — <recommendation.rationale>
  - **Fix hint:** `<fix_hint>` (marked "(edited by reviewer)" when `edited_hint == true`; "— (no steering hint supplied)" when empty)
  - **Prior:** disposition=<prior_disposition> · score=<prior_score>

- **F016** — ...

#### Skipped

- **F006** — [first line of claim]
  - Reviewer skipped during walkthrough.

#### Stopped

- **F023** — [first line of claim]
  - Reviewer requested stop at this finding. Not mutated.
  - Resume with `/adams-review-walkthrough $threshold`.

#### Pre-existing issues filed

- **F026** — <issue title> → <issue_url>
- **F028** — <issue title> → <issue_url>

---

Decisions log: this comment is append-only audit — it's never edited
in place. Each `/adams-review-walkthrough` run posts a fresh entry.
Current state: see the main review comment and `artifact.md`.
```

`$scope_tier_title` is `"Qualifying"` when `scope_tier == qualifying`,
`"Full skip set"` when `scope_tier == full`, and `"Pre-existing only"`
when `scope_tier == none` (the walk was skipped because
`scope_full_count == 0`). In the `none` case, `scope_count == 0` and
`decisions[]` is empty — the Promoted/Skipped/Stopped subsections all
omit, leaving only the Pre-existing issues subsection. The header
sentence becomes "Walking the **Pre-existing only** scope: of **0**
non-auto-eligible finding(s), 0 promoted, 0 skipped, 0 stopped." —
accurate and matches the §7 guard (which skips the POST only when
BOTH decisions and issues_filed are empty).

Emit the Pre-existing issues subsection only when `issues_filed[]`
is non-empty. Other sections continue to follow the existing "emit
only when non-empty" rule. Similarly, omit the `$unreviewed_count
unreviewed` clause from the header sentence when `$unreviewed_count
== 0` (i.e., every scoped finding was promoted, skipped, or stopped
at). Omit the "Promoted findings will be picked up by the next
`/adams-review-fix`…" sentence entirely when `$promote_count == 0`
— with zero promotes it describes a non-event (and misleadingly
hints that a fix run is pending when it isn't).

#### 7.2. POST via `gh api`

```bash
comment_body_path=$(mktemp -t adams-walkthrough-body.XXXXXX)
err_tmp=$(mktemp -t adams-walkthrough-gh-err.XXXXXX)
# ... write the rendered markdown to $comment_body_path ...

decisions_comment_id=$(gh api \
    --method POST \
    "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$pr_number/comments" \
    -F "body=@$comment_body_path" \
    --jq '.id' 2>"$err_tmp")
gh_rc=$?

rm -f "$comment_body_path"
```

`gh api` auto-substitutes `{owner}` and `{repo}` placeholders with
the current git remote's owner/repo when invoked from inside the
repo working tree — no manual resolution needed. Run the command
from `$repo_root` (the command file's $repo_root is already set at
step 2; the gh process inherits working directory unless we explicitly
cd).

Stderr is captured to `$err_tmp` (mirrors the §6.5.2 `gh issue create`
pattern) so the "log to trace on failure" branch below has something
to log. Without the `2>` redirect, stderr would print to the user's
terminal and the trace entry would be blank.

On success, `rm -f "$err_tmp"`. Capture `decisions_comment_id` into
trace only (do NOT mutate the artifact's `comment_id`).

On `gh` failure (`gh_rc != 0`), read `$err_tmp`, append a block under
tag `walkthrough_decisions_comment_failed` to `trace.md` containing
the captured stderr AND the rendered markdown (so the reviewer can
recover the content and manually post it), then `rm -f "$err_tmp"`.

### 8. Append walkthrough block to `trace.md`

```bash
{
    printf '## walkthrough (%s)\n' "$walkthrough_ts"
    printf 'review_id=%s scope_tier=%s threshold=%s scope_count=%s promote_count=%s skip_count=%s stop_count=%s unreviewed_count=%s\n' \
        "$review_id" "$scope_tier" "$threshold" "$scope_count" "$promote_count" "$skip_count" "$stop_count" "$unreviewed_count"
    printf 'decisions:\n'
    # one line per decision, in order
    for d in "${decisions[@]}"; do
        edited_marker=""
        if [[ "$(jq -r '.edited_hint // false' <<<"$d")" == "true" ]]; then
            edited_marker=" hint_edited=true"
        fi
        printf '  %s %s option=%s hint=%s%s\n' \
            "$(jq -r '.finding_id' <<<"$d")" \
            "$(jq -r '.action' <<<"$d")" \
            "$(jq -r '.option_label // "—"' <<<"$d")" \
            "$(jq -r '.fix_hint // "—"' <<<"$d")" \
            "$edited_marker"
    done
    if (( ${#issues_filed[@]} > 0 )); then
        printf 'pre_existing_issues:\n'
        for i in "${issues_filed[@]}"; do
            printf '  %s %s\n' \
                "$(jq -r '.finding_id' <<<"$i")" \
                "$(jq -r '.issue_url' <<<"$i")"
        done
    fi
    [[ -n "${decisions_comment_id:-}" ]] && \
        printf 'decisions_comment_id=%s\n' "$decisions_comment_id"
    printf '\n'
} >> "$trace_log_path"
```

### 9. User-visible summary

Print a clear summary block to chat (plain text, not a tool call):

```
Walkthrough complete. Scope: $scope_tier_title.
Of $scope_count finding(s) in scope:
  Promoted:    $promote_count
  Skipped:     $skip_count
  Stopped:     $stop_count
  Unreviewed:  $unreviewed_count

Pre-existing issues filed: <N; list id → url pairs below, or omit section>
  F026 → <url>
  F028 → <url>

Cumulative sub-agent spend: <total> tokens across <invs> invocations.
Cumulative orchestrator spend: <cache_read> cache-read / <output> output / <cache_creation> cache-creation / <input> fresh input across <turns> turns.

Promoted findings are now auto-fix-eligible via the human_confirmation
bypass (§27.6). To apply them:

  /adams-review-fix $threshold

Decisions log comment: <url to the POSTed comment, if PR mode>
Main review comment: updated in place.

You can resume later by re-running /adams-review-walkthrough — the
scope filter naturally excludes anything you already promoted, so the
$unreviewed_count unreviewed finding(s) plus any newly-added ones
will be what you see.
```

Read the cumulative spend numbers from the artifact (populated by
§6.1's re-tally). Direct `jq -r` call so stdout is the chat line
itself, not a JSON-quoted string (`artifact-read.sh --filter` doesn't
enable raw mode). Note that §6.5 issue-filer agents dispatched after
the tally won't be included in these lines — they (and the
orchestrator turns that dispatch them) surface on the next lifecycle
command's re-tally (§6.1 above documents this). Omit each line
entirely when its source field is absent/null — matches
`artifact-render.py`'s renderer guard:

```bash
subagent_token_line=$(jq -r '
    if (.subagent_tokens.total // null) != null and (.subagent_tokens.invocations // null) != null
    then "Cumulative sub-agent spend: \(.subagent_tokens.total) tokens across \(.subagent_tokens.invocations) invocations."
    else empty end
' "$artifact_path")

orchestrator_token_line=$(jq -r '
    if (.orchestrator_tokens.turn_count // null) != null
    then "Cumulative orchestrator spend: \(.orchestrator_tokens.cache_read) cache-read / \(.orchestrator_tokens.total_output) output / \(.orchestrator_tokens.cache_creation) cache-creation / \(.orchestrator_tokens.total_input) fresh input across \(.orchestrator_tokens.turn_count) turns."
    else empty end
' "$artifact_path")
```

Omit the "Unreviewed" line entirely (and the final re-run sentence's
unreviewed-count clause) when `$unreviewed_count == 0` — keeps the
common-case summary tidy. Omit the "Pre-existing issues filed"
section entirely when `issues_filed[]` is empty.

When `mode == "pr"` AND `scope_preexisting_count > 0` AND
`${#issues_filed[@]} == 0` (the reviewer saw pre-existing findings but
chose "Skip — don't file any"), add a one-line note after the
summary block:

```
Note: $scope_preexisting_count pre-existing finding(s) not filed as issues.
Re-run /adams-review-walkthrough to revisit.
```

On any step failure earlier in the run, append a `Note:` section
listing the deferred failures and their recovery actions (same
pattern as `/adams-review-promote` step 10).

## What this command does NOT do

- **No fix-run.** Walkthrough is metadata-only (via promote's patch
  primitive). Run `/adams-review-fix [threshold]` afterward to apply.
- **No `disposition=disproven` handling.** Disproven findings need
  `/adams-review-promote <id> --force` with a conscious justification;
  the walkthrough scope filter excludes them.
- **No cross-branch walkthrough.** Operates on `latest.txt` for the
  current branch — same as promote and fix.
- **No resumption state file.** If you quit mid-walkthrough, the
  promotions you already made stand. Re-invoking the walkthrough
  skips them naturally (the scope filter excludes
  `human_confirmation != null`).

## Appendix — shared promote-core fragment

The body below is the verbatim content of
`commands/_shared/promote-core.md`, included once via the Claude Code
preprocessor. Step 5.5 above references this content — treat it as
the per-iteration playbook for a single promote decision, not as
a single-shot action.
