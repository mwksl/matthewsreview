## Phase 4 — Validation (lane-aware)

Phase 3's survivors get validated: deep-lane candidates (correctness +
security outside trivial mode) go through Phase 4a — one Opus sub-agent
per candidate. Everything else (plus every candidate under
`trivial_mode`) goes through Phase 4b — one Sonnet sub-agent per
candidate, lighter.

Chain-wave retry (§4): the orchestrator dispatches Wave 1 per
candidate; if any Wave 1 output references further candidates via
`related_candidates_to_investigate`, the orchestrator aggregates
those at the orchestrator level and dispatches Wave 2. Hard cap at
two waves.

Capture `phase_4_start_epoch=$(date +%s)` as the first action of this
phase — step 4.7 logs the elapsed time.

### 4.1. Partition candidates into lanes

Read the phase-3 survivors (findings parked at `pending_validation`;
gate-fail `below_gate` and pre-existing `pre_existing_report` findings
are excluded by the positive filter):

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" \
  --filter '[.findings[] | select(.disposition == "pending_validation") | {id, impact_type, validation_lane}]'
```

If `trivial_mode == true`: force ALL candidates into the light lane.
Per §13.9 + §19.6, light lane under trivial_mode refuses to emit
`auto_fixable` — keeps v1's trivial-mode findings review-only.

Else: partition by `validation_lane` (which was set at Phase 1 based
on `impact_type`):

- `validation_lane == "deep"` → Wave 1 deep lane (Opus).
- `validation_lane == "light"` → Wave 1 light lane (Sonnet).

### 4.2. Wave 1 — deep lane (Opus per candidate; skipped under trivial_mode)

For each deep-lane candidate, launch one `Agent` tool-use with
`model: opus`, `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Dispatch all in one
orchestrator turn for concurrency.

Each sub-agent receives:
- The full stored finding JSON. `evidence_snippet` is not among the
  stored fields — the validator works from `file + line_range + claim`
  plus the Read/grep tools it uses to look at the diff directly.
- `$claude_md_paths` (absolute paths).
- If this is a retry-mode run (Stage 3 context): the finding's prior
  `fix_attempts` for context. In Stage 2 `/adams-review`, `fix_attempts`
  is always empty — noted here for symmetry with Stage 3's retry path.

Prompt essence (per §19.5):

> its blast radius, and — if real — produce a concrete fix proposal.
>
> **Candidate:** `<finding JSON>`
> **CLAUDE.md paths:** `$claude_md_paths`

> 2. **Trace blast radius.** For every writer, consumer, parallel path,
>    and relevant test — enumerate them in `blast_radius`. A fix that

### 4.3. Wave 1 — light lane (Sonnet per candidate)

For each light-lane candidate (including every candidate under
`trivial_mode`), launch one `Agent` tool-use with `model: sonnet`.

Prompt essence (per §19.6):

> You are a light confirmation validator.
>
> **Candidate:** `<finding JSON>`
> **CLAUDE.md paths:** `$claude_md_paths`
> **trivial_mode:** `<true|false>` (when true, do NOT emit `actionability: auto_fixable` — only `manual` or `report_only` per §13.9).
>
> Verify the finding's accuracy only: does the CLAUDE.md really contain
> this rule? Does the adjacent comment really conflict? Adjust score
> accordingly.
>
> Flag `actionability: auto_fixable` ONLY for very mechanical rules
> where the fix is unambiguous (e.g. import ordering, specific constant
> naming). Judgment calls → `manual`. Architecture findings default to
> `report_only`.
>
> Return JSON:
> ```
> {
>   "decision": "confirmed" | "disproven" | "uncertain",
>   "score_phase4": <0-100>,
>   "actionability": "auto_fixable" | "manual" | "report_only",
>   "note": "brief rationale"
> }
> ```

### 4.4. Apply §13.1 Phase-4 decision table (per candidate)

For each Wave 1 result, first log tokens:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/log-tokens.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase <phase_4a|phase_4b> \
  --agent-role validator --finding-id "$id" \
  --agent-id <id> --model <opus|sonnet> \
  --tokens <N or null>
```

Then apply the decision table. Derive inputs from the sub-agent's
return: `score_phase4` takes precedence over `decision` when the two
disagree. A validator that returns `decision: "confirmed"` with
`score_phase4: 40` is treated as disproven (the row the score lands on
wins); a validator returning `decision: "disproven"` with
`score_phase4: 70` is treated as confirmed. Orchestrator should log
the conflict to `trace.md` but trust the score. Validators shouldn't
return such mismatches, but err toward the structured field over the
natural-language label.

| Score | Rule | Disposition | is_actionable | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `< 45` | disproven | `disproven` | false | reason: "disproven by Phase 4: <summary>" |
| `45-59` | uncertain | `uncertain` | false | reason: "uncertain (Phase 4 inconclusive)" |
| `60-74` AND `actionability=auto_fixable` | | `confirmed_auto` | true | confirmed_strength: moderate |
| `60-74` AND `actionability=manual` | | `confirmed_manual` | false | confirmed_strength: moderate |
| `60-74` AND `actionability=report_only` | | `confirmed_report` | false | confirmed_strength: moderate |
| `75+` AND `actionability=auto_fixable` | | `confirmed_auto` | true | confirmed_strength: strong |
| `75+` AND `actionability=manual` | | `confirmed_manual` | false | confirmed_strength: strong |
| `75+` AND `actionability=report_only` | | `confirmed_report` | false | confirmed_strength: strong |

Apply via one `artifact-patch.py` call per finding. Example for
`score=72, actionability=auto_fixable`:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-patch.py \
  --path "$artifact_path" --finding-id "$id" \
  --set "score_phase4=72" \
  --set disposition=confirmed_auto \
  --set confirmed_strength=moderate \
  --set actionability=auto_fixable \
  --set reason=null
```

For deep-lane candidates in the **confirmed band** (post-rule
disposition ∈ `{confirmed_auto, confirmed_manual, confirmed_report}`,
i.e. `score_phase4 >= 60`), ALSO persist `validation_result`. Gate
the write on the resolved disposition, NOT on the sub-agent's
`decision` label — the score-wins-over-decision precedence rule
(stated above) means a validator returning
`decision: "disproven", score_phase4: 70` is treated as confirmed
by the table; its `validation_result` must still persist or Phase 5
and the rendered report lose their fix-proposal / blast-radius
context.

The schema at `finding.validation_result`
(`schema-v1.json` §defs.validation_result) is the NESTED object — the
sub-agent's outer response includes `{validation_result, score_phase4,
decision, actionability, related_candidates_to_investigate}`, so you
must extract `.validation_result` before writing:

```bash
# Gate on resolved disposition (post score-decision precedence rule),
# not on the sub-agent's decision label. Only confirmed band gets a
# stored validation_result: schema requires every nested field of
# validation_result to be non-null, and disproven/uncertain findings
# don't run the sub-agent all the way through producing the fix_proposal
# + verification_context sections.
case "$resolved_disposition" in
    confirmed_auto|confirmed_manual|confirmed_report)
        # Extract just the nested validation_result object; if the outer
        # response shape is already just the inner object, `// .` is a
        # no-op.
        jq -c '.validation_result // .' <<<"$subagent_response_json" \
            > "/tmp/val-$id.json"
        ~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-patch.py \
          --path "$artifact_path" --finding-id "$id" \
          --set-json "validation_result=@/tmp/val-$id.json"
        ;;
esac
rm -f "/tmp/val-$id.json"
```

(Write the validation_result JSON to a temp file first; the `@file`
form avoids quoting hell on large objects.)

On score parse failure (sub-agent returned unparseable JSON even after
one retry): leave `score_phase4=null`, set `disposition=uncertain`,
`reason="Phase 4 parse failure — manual review"`.

### 4.5. Wave 2 (chain retry — optional)

After Wave 1 completes, collect every
`related_candidates_to_investigate` entry from Wave 1 deep-lane outputs.
Dedup by (file, line_range, claim-fingerprint — a short prefix or
hash). Drop any entry that overlaps substantially with an existing
finding (since that was already investigated).

If the resulting list is non-empty AND we haven't already done Wave 2:

1. For each related candidate, **build a full schema-valid finding
   object** (same transformation the Phase-1 jq builder does — schema's
   `additionalProperties: false` rejects singular `source_family` and
   requires every finding field to be present). Example:

   ```bash
   wave2_finding=$(jq -n \
     --arg id "F$(printf '%03d' $finding_counter)" \
     --arg parent "$parent_finding_id" \
     --argjson cand "$related_candidate" \
     '{
        id: $id,
        sources: ["L2-structural"],            # Wave 2 is structural-derived
        source_families: ["structural-family"],
        impact_type: ($cand.impact_type // "correctness"),
        origin: ($cand.origin // "introduced_by_pr"),
        origin_confidence: ($cand.origin_confidence // "medium"),
        actionability: "auto_fixable",
        validation_lane: "deep",
        current_state: "open",
        disposition: "pending_validation",
        is_actionable: false,
        reason: null,
        confirmed_strength: null,
        file: $cand.file,
        line_range: ($cand.line_range // [1,1]),
        claim: $cand.claim,
        score_phase3: null,
        score_phase4: null,
        score_history: [],
        validation_result: null,
        fix_attempts: [],
        introduced_in_sha: null,
        suggested_follow_up: null,
        related_parent_finding_id: $parent
      }')

   ~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-patch.py \
     --path "$artifact_path" --add-finding "$wave2_finding"
   ```

2. Run Phase 3 scoring on these new candidates (one Sonnet call each —
   can fan out). Same step 3.3 pattern as the first pass.
3. Dispatch Wave 2 deep-lane validators on any that pass the Phase-3
   gate, same prompt as Wave 1 BUT add: "This is Wave 2 — do NOT emit
   further `related_candidates_to_investigate` entries." (Hard-cap
   enforcement: §4 says "Hard cap at 2 waves.")
4. Apply the decision table per step 4.4 for Wave 2 results.

If the list is empty, proceed to step 4.6.

### 4.6. Pre-existing override re-assertion (§13.1)

After Phase 4 completes, sweep the findings list one more time:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" \
  --filter '[.findings[] | select(.origin == "pre_existing" and .origin_confidence == "high" and .disposition != "pre_existing_report") | .id]'
```

This catches cases where Phase 4a's deep validation bumped a pre-existing
finding's score into the confirmed band — the pre-existing rule trumps.
For each returned id:

```bash
~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-patch.py \
  --path "$artifact_path" --finding-id "$id" \
  --set disposition=pre_existing_report \
  --set is_actionable=false \
  --set actionability=report_only \
  --set confirmed_strength=null \
  --set reason=null
```

(The validation_result stays on the finding — it's still valuable context
for the user in the report — but the disposition forces it out of the
actionable path.)

### 4.7. Log Phase 4 summary

```bash
phase_4_elapsed=$(( $(date +%s) - phase_4_start_epoch ))

by_disp=$(~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-read.sh \
  --path "$artifact_path" --summary | jq -c '.counts_by_disposition')

~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 4 --name validation \
  --elapsed "$phase_4_elapsed" \
  --summary "$(jq -nc --argjson by_disp "$by_disp" '$by_disp | to_entries | map("\(.key)=\(.value)") | join(", ")')"

~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/log-phase.sh \
  --review-dir "$review_dir" --phase 4 --record "$(jq -nc \
    --argjson elapsed "$phase_4_elapsed" \
    --argjson by_disp "$by_disp" \
    --argjson total_open "$(~/.claude/commands/_shared/tools/artifact-read.sh --path "$artifact_path" --filter '[.findings[] | select(.current_state == "open")] | length')" \
    '{name:"validation", elapsed_sec:$elapsed, counts_by_state:{open:$total_open}, counts_by_disposition:$by_disp, delta:"<summarize e.g. +9 confirmed_auto, -5 disproven>"}')"
```

### Working-set delta after Phase 4

- Every non-pre-existing, non-below-gate finding has `score_phase4` set
  and a final `disposition` from the §13.1 Phase-4 table.
- Deep-lane confirmed findings have `validation_result` populated
  (evidence, blast_radius, fix_proposal, verification_context).
- Light-lane confirmed findings have `actionability` (rarely
  `auto_fixable`; mostly `manual`/`report_only`, and never
  `auto_fixable` under trivial_mode).
- Pre-existing high-confidence findings are re-asserted to
  `pre_existing_report` regardless of Phase 4 verdict.
- `tokens.jsonl` + one entry per Wave-1 + Wave-2 sub-agent.
- `phases.jsonl` + Phase 4 record with the first deeply-populated
  `counts_by_disposition`.
