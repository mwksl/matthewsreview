# assign-finding-ids.sh — deterministic finding-id assignment over a
# pooled candidate set (DESIGN §13.12).
#
# Used at the Phase 1 + Phase 1.5 join point: after every internal lens
# has returned and (under --ensemble) the Sonnet normalizer has emitted
# its candidate array, the orchestrator combines the two pools into one
# array and pipes it here. This helper sorts by source priority (stable
# within source = preserves input order), then assigns F001..F0NN.
#
# Usage:
#   assign-finding-ids.sh < pooled_candidates.json
#   echo "$pooled" | assign-finding-ids.sh
#
# Stdin:  JSON array of candidate objects. Each element must have a
#         `sources` array; the helper reads `sources[0]` to bucket into
#         a priority class. Elements with an empty/missing `sources`
#         array, or a source string not on the known list, fall to
#         priority 99 (sorted last; still gets an id).
#
# Stdout: same array (same post-sort element order) with `.id` set to
#         F001, F002, ... (zero-padded to 3 digits) in sort order.
#
# Source priority order (matches per-lens dispatch sequencing in
# 01-detection.md step 1.3):
#
#   1  L1-diff-local
#   2  L2-structural
#   3  L3-claude-md
#   4  L4-comments
#   5  L5-ux
#   6  L6-security
#   7  external-pr:<author_login>  (sub-ordered by author_login)
#   8  codex
#   9  coderabbit
#   99 unknown (forward-compat)
#
# Exits: 0 success; 1 stdin is not a JSON array.

Usage: assign-finding-ids.sh < pooled_candidates.json

Stdin:  JSON array of candidate objects; each element should have
        a `sources` array (`sources[0]` drives the priority sort).
Stdout: the same array (sorted) with `.id` set to F001..F0NN.
